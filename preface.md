# Preface

*Updated: v2026.01.29*

This manual is written for new and intermediate Aurora players. If you're learning Aurora for the first time or still finding your footing, you'll find explanations of core mechanics, worked examples like designing your first missile cruiser or planning a colonial mining network, and practical guidance that should accelerate your learning considerably.

If you're an experienced player, you'll spot errors — an outdated formula, a mechanic that changed three versions ago, a nuance we've oversimplified. We know. Please help us fix them.

Some experts object to this manual's existence. The criticism usually takes one of two forms: that an imperfect manual shouldn't exist at all, or that AI-assisted documentation is inherently untrustworthy. Both positions share a common result — beginners get nothing while waiting for a perfect manual that no expert has time to write.

Regarding AI reliability: this manual is specifically designed to prevent hallucination. Every factual claim cites the Aurora game database with exact table and column references. Claims we cannot verify are explicitly marked. When tested against "known AI hallucinations" circulating in the community, the manual's database-backed citations have provided definitive resolution. For the full explanation of these measures, see [Section 1.4.8 How This Manual Prevents AI Hallucination](1-introduction/1.4-ai-assisted-play.md#148-how-this-manual-prevents-ai-hallucination).

We take a different view. A manual with tracked errors that get corrected over time is more useful than no manual at all. Claims cite their sources. Claims we cannot verify are marked as such.

We make no claim to mastery. The contributors to this manual are themselves still learning Aurora's depths. Our only goal is to help more people experience what Steve Walmsley has created — a game of remarkable scope and detail that rewards the time invested in understanding it. Aurora deserves a larger community, and that community needs somewhere to start.

If you find an error, please open an issue at [github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual). A correction from someone who knows takes minutes. Discovering the same error through play takes hours. Waiting for perfection takes forever.
