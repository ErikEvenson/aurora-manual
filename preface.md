# Preface

This manual is written primarily for new and intermediate Aurora players. If you're encountering Aurora for the first time, or still finding your footing after a few games, you'll find detailed explanations of mechanics, worked examples, and practical guidance that should accelerate your learning considerably.

If you're an experienced player with hundreds of hours in Aurora, you probably don't need this manual. You've already internalized the mechanics through trial and error, forum reading, and hard-won experience. You'll likely spot errors here — an outdated formula, a mechanic that changed three versions ago, a nuance we've oversimplified. We're sorry. Please help us improve it.

Some experts object to this manual's existence. The criticism usually takes one of two forms: that an imperfect manual shouldn't exist at all, or that AI-assisted documentation is inherently untrustworthy. Both positions share a common result — beginners get nothing while waiting for a perfect manual that no expert has time to write.

We take a different view. A manual with errors that are explicitly marked, tracked, and corrected over time is more useful than no manual at all. Every factual claim cites its source — typically the game database or developer forum posts. Claims we cannot verify are marked as such. When errors are discovered, we fix them and document what went wrong.

We make no claim to mastery. The contributors to this manual are themselves still learning Aurora's depths. Our only goal is to help more people experience what Steve Walmsley has created — a game of remarkable scope and detail that rewards the time invested in understanding it. Aurora deserves a larger community, and that community needs somewhere to start.

This manual will never be perfect. Aurora is too complex, changes too frequently, and has too many edge cases for any documentation to capture completely. But it can be useful, and it can improve.

If you find an error, please open an issue at [github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual). A correction from someone who knows takes minutes. Discovering the same error through play takes hours. Waiting for perfection takes forever.
