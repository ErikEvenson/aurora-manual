# 7.3 Research Facilities

Research facilities are the physical infrastructure that generates research points. Without labs, even the most brilliant scientist produces nothing. Building and managing your research infrastructure is a critical investment decision that balances immediate production needs against long-term technological advancement.

## 7.3.1 Research Labs

Research labs are ground installations that generate research points (RP) when assigned to a project led by a scientist.

**Types of Research Labs:**

Aurora C# has a single type of research lab installation. All labs produce the same base RP output regardless of which research category they are assigned to. The same lab can be used for Power and Propulsion research one year and Energy Weapons the next -- they are not specialized.

**Base Output:**

Each research lab generates a base number of RP per year. The starting value is typically around 100 RP per lab per year, which can be improved through the "Research Rate" technology in the Construction and Production category.

**Technology Improvements:**

The "Research Rate" technology line increases the RP output of each lab:
- Each level in this technology raises the per-lab RP output.
- This technology has compound benefits: more RP per lab means all current and future research completes faster.
- Researching improved research rate early is a high-value investment similar to improved construction rate.

**Construction:**

Research labs are built by construction factories:
- They have a significant Build Point cost (approximately 2,400 BP for a standard lab).
- They require specific minerals to construct (including Uridium and Mercassium).
- Labs are among the more expensive ground installations to build, representing a substantial investment.
- Building labs trades immediate production capacity (construction factories are building labs instead of other things) for long-term technological progress.

**Population Requirements:**

Research labs require population to staff. Each lab draws workers from the colony's population pool. On smaller colonies, labs compete with mines and factories for available workers.

**Lab Allocation:**

Labs are allocated to specific research projects through the Research window:
- Each active project receives a number of labs from the colony's total.
- Unallocated labs generate no RP (they must be assigned to a project with a scientist).
- Labs can be reallocated between projects freely and instantly.
- The total labs available equals the number of lab installations on the colony.

**Optimal Lab Counts:**

The ideal number of labs depends on your scientist pool:
- Total labs should roughly equal the sum of your scientists' administration ratings.
- Labs beyond what your scientists can supervise are wasted unless you expect new scientists soon.
- If you have more scientists than labs can support, build more labs.
- If you have more labs than scientists can supervise, invest elsewhere until new scientists appear.

> **Tip:** Research labs are expensive to build and represent an opportunity cost against other installations. As a rule of thumb, build labs in proportion to your scientist pool -- there is little value in having 50 labs if your best scientist can only supervise 15 effectively.

## 7.3.2 Orbital Research

In addition to ground-based research labs, Aurora C# allows research to be conducted from orbital installations and ships.

**Research Stations:**

Orbital research stations are space-based installations that can host research labs:
- They function identically to ground-based labs in terms of RP output.
- Research stations do not require ground-based population support (they have their own crew).
- They can be placed in orbit around any body, including those that cannot support ground colonies.
- Construction requires a shipyard (they are orbital installations, not ground-based).

**Advantages of Orbital Research:**

- Can be placed in orbit of bodies without habitable surfaces.
- Do not consume colony infrastructure or ground capacity.
- Can be relocated if needed (though this is unusual).
- Protected from ground-based threats (though vulnerable to orbital attack).

**Disadvantages:**

- More expensive to construct than equivalent ground labs (requires shipyard time and materials).
- Cannot benefit from shared colony infrastructure.
- Must be defended against space-based threats.
- Generally less efficient than simply building more ground labs on an established colony.

**Ship-Based Research:**

Some ship designs can incorporate research lab modules:
- These labs function identically to ground or station labs.
- Ship-based labs are useful for research expeditions or mobile research capacity.
- They are relatively rare in practice since ground labs are cheaper and more efficient.
- Specific scenarios where ship labs shine: researching alien technology in the field, or providing research capacity while colonizing a new system.

> **Tip:** For most empires, ground-based research labs on your homeworld or primary colony provide the best value. Orbital research stations are a niche option for specific scenarios (like researching in a system where you have no habitable body). Invest in ground labs first and consider orbital options only when you have specific needs that ground labs cannot meet.

## 7.3.3 Maximizing Output

Getting the most research output from your facilities requires careful management of scientists, lab allocation, and technology investments. Here are the key strategies for maximizing research efficiency.

**Strategy 1: Research Rate Technology First**

One of the highest-ROI early research investments is the Research Rate technology itself. Each level increases all lab output, which accelerates all future research. The compound effect means researching this early pays dividends for the entire game.

Calculation example:
- 20 labs at 100 RP/year = 2,000 RP/year baseline
- After researching improved labs (150 RP/year): 20 labs at 150 RP/year = 3,000 RP/year
- The 1,000 RP/year increase applies to ALL future research, not just one project.

**Strategy 2: Match Scientists to Fields**

Always assign scientists to their specialty field. The bonus difference is substantial:
- 30% bonus scientist in their field: 1.30x output multiplier
- Same scientist outside their field: 1.0x output (no bonus)
- A mediocre specialist (15% bonus in field) outperforms a brilliant generalist (30% bonus) working out of field.

**Strategy 3: Respect Administration Caps**

Assigning more labs than a scientist's admin rating wastes lab capacity:
- 10 admin scientist with 10 labs: 100% efficiency on all labs
- 10 admin scientist with 20 labs: 100% on first 10, ~50% on remaining 10 = 75% average efficiency
- Better to split those extra 10 labs to another scientist's project.

**Strategy 4: Minimize Idle Time**

Research capacity sitting idle produces nothing. Minimise gaps between projects:
- Use the research queue to automatically start new projects upon completion.
- Reassign labs immediately when a project completes.
- Keep a prioritized list of "next projects" ready for each scientist.
- Check research status regularly to catch completions early.

**Strategy 5: Focus vs. Breadth**

Concentrating all labs on one project completes it fastest, but leaves other fields unresearched. The optimal approach depends on your situation:
- **Focus** (all labs on one project): Best when one technology will unlock a critical capability (e.g., jump drives, a weapon you desperately need).
- **Breadth** (labs spread across 4-6 projects): Best for steady advancement across multiple fields during peacetime.
- **Hybrid** (60% to priority, 40% spread): A common compromise that advances priority research quickly while maintaining progress elsewhere.

**Strategy 6: Scientist Succession Planning**

Scientists die. Prepare for this:
- Identify which research areas are most dependent on a single scientist.
- When a new scientist appears in a critical field, assign them to a secondary project in that field to build their research queue.
- Never leave a critical technology dependent on a single aging scientist with no replacement.

**Strategy 7: Technology Synergies**

Some technologies amplify each other:
- Research Rate + Construction Rate: Faster labs produce faster factories.
- Engine tech + Fuel Efficiency: Better engines AND lower fuel costs means more fleet capability per mineral invested.
- Sensor Range + Weapon Range: Detection at longer range only matters if you can shoot at that range too.

Plan research to unlock synergistic technologies close together for maximum combined impact.

> **Tip:** The single most impactful research management action is ensuring no lab or scientist is ever idle. Even a suboptimal assignment (wrong field, too many labs) produces more than an idle facility. Fill all assignments first, then optimise second.
