# 7.4 Tech Categories

This section provides an overview of each research category, highlighting the most important technologies within each, what they unlock, and their strategic significance. For detailed prerequisite chains, consult the in-game Research window.

## 7.4.1 Biology and Genetics

Biology and Genetics research affects population growth, terraforming, ground combat, and various biological sciences.

**Key Technology Lines:**

**Terraforming Rate:**
Increases the rate at which terraforming installations (see [Section 5.5 Terraforming](../5-colonies/5.5-terraforming.md)) modify a planet's atmosphere. Higher levels mean faster terraforming, which is critical for making hostile worlds habitable. Each level roughly doubles the rate of atmospheric change.

**Genetic Modification:**
Allows modification of your species' environmental tolerances (temperature range, atmospheric preferences, gravity tolerance). Advanced levels can significantly expand the range of worlds your population can colonize without infrastructure support.

**Biology Research:**
Provides improvements to population growth rate, allowing your empire to expand and staff new colonies faster. Also unlocks certain ground combat improvements related to troop endurance and recovery.

**Terraforming Gases:**
Unlocks the ability to add or remove specific atmospheric gases. Different gases require different technology levels. This determines which atmospheres you can modify and which remain beyond your current capability.

**Colonization Cost Reduction (v2.4.0+):**
Reduces the colony cost threshold at which worlds become viable for habitation. As of v2.4.0, the research costs for this technology line were halved, and its effects are now visually reflected in the game: system body colors on the System View and icons on the Galactic Map account for your current Colonization Cost Reduction technology level. This makes it easier to identify which worlds have become viable targets as your technology improves.

**Strategic Significance:**

Biology and Genetics is a long-term investment category. Its benefits are subtle but cumulative:

- Faster terraforming opens up more colonization options without infrastructure costs.
- Genetic modification eliminates the need for infrastructure on marginal worlds.
- Population growth improvements accelerate all other economic development.
- Not typically a first-priority research area, but neglecting it entirely creates long-term habitability constraints.

> **Tip:** If your home system has a Venus-like or Mars-like world with good minerals, early terraforming research can unlock a second major colony without the infrastructure overhead. Check your system survey results before dismissing this category.

## 7.4.2 Construction and Production

Construction and Production research improves your industrial base -- the factories, mines, shipyards, and research facilities that power your economy.

**Key Technology Lines:**

**Construction Rate:**
Increases the Build Points per factory per year. This is one of the most impactful technologies in the game because it accelerates the production of everything else. Each level provides a significant multiplier to all ground-based construction.

**Mining Production:**
Increases the tons per mine per year extraction rate. Directly translates to more minerals from existing mine infrastructure. Critical for maintaining mineral supply as your empire grows.

**Research Rate:**
Increases the RP per lab per year. Accelerates all future research, creating a compound benefit. One of the highest-ROI early investments.

**Shipyard Construction Rate:**
Increases the build rate of orbital shipyards, meaning ships are produced faster. Essential for maintaining naval production as ship designs grow larger and more complex.

**Fuel Production Rate:**
Increases the output of fuel refineries, which convert mined Sorium into usable fuel. Important for empires with large fleets and high fuel consumption.

**Strategic Significance:**

Construction and Production is the "economic engine" category. Technologies here do not directly improve combat capability, but they accelerate everything else. A strong C&P research programme means:

- More ships built faster.
- More minerals extracted per mine.
- Faster research across all categories.
- Greater overall economic output at every stage of the game.

Many experienced players consider Construction Rate, Mining Production, and Research Rate to be the three highest-priority early research topics regardless of strategic doctrine.

> **Tip:** Research Rate and Construction Rate together create a virtuous cycle: better labs research faster, which unlocks better factories faster, which build more labs faster. Prioritize both in your first decade and the compound growth will outpace any other early investment.

## 7.4.3 Defensive Systems

Defensive Systems research provides the technologies for armour, shields, and electronic countermeasures that protect your ships and installations.

**Key Technology Lines:**

**Armour Technology:**
Each level of armour technology increases the strength (hit points) per layer of armour on your ships. Higher-tech armour absorbs more damage per ton of ship mass dedicated to armour. This is the most straightforward defensive investment -- tougher armour means ships survive more hits.

Armour progression:

- Conventional Armour
- Duranium Armour
- High Density Duranium
- Composite Armour
- Ceramic Composite
- Laminate Composite
- Compressed Carbon
- Biphased Carbide
- Crystaline Composite
- Superdense Armour
- Bonded Superdense
- Coherent Superdense
- Collapsium

**Shield Technology:**
Shields provide regenerating protection that absorbs damage before it reaches armour. Shield technologies improve:

- Shield strength (total absorption capacity)
- Shield regeneration rate (how quickly shields recover between hits)
- Shield size (tonnage required per shield generator)

Shields are power-hungry and require significant reactor capacity to support.

**Electronic Countermeasures (ECM):**
ECM reduces the accuracy of incoming missiles and fire control systems targeting your ships:

- Each ECM level provides a percentage reduction to incoming fire accuracy.
- ECM is tonnage-efficient but only effective against guided weapons.
- Stacks with other defensive measures.

**Cloaking Technology:**
Allows ships to reduce their thermal and electromagnetic signatures, making them harder to detect:

- Higher levels provide greater signature reduction.
- Complete cloaking is never possible -- there is always some residual signature.
- Requires significant tonnage and power investment.
- Tactical use: scouting, ambushes, and avoiding detection.

**Strategic Significance:**

Defensive technology determines ship survivability. Your doctrine choice matters:

- **Armour-heavy:** Ships survive sustained fire, work best with short-range weapons. Cheap but heavy.
- **Shield-heavy:** Ships regenerate protection between engagements, work best at range. Expensive in power and tonnage.
- **ECM-focused:** Ships avoid being hit, work best against missile-heavy opponents. Light but vulnerable if ECM is overwhelmed.
- **Balanced:** Most common approach, combining armour with modest shields.

> **Tip:** Match your defensive technology to your weapon doctrine. Beam weapon ships that fight at close range need heavy armour. Missile ships that fight at stand-off range can rely more on ECM and speed to avoid return fire. Mismatching defence and offence leads to suboptimal ship designs.

## 7.4.4 Energy Weapons

Energy Weapons research provides the technology for beam weapons -- direct-fire weapons that hit instantly and require no ammunition.

**Key Technology Lines:**

**Laser Focal Size:**
Determines the size and power of laser weapons. Larger focal sizes produce more powerful lasers that deal more damage at greater range. The focal size technology line is the primary determinant of laser effectiveness.

**Laser Wavelength:**
Determines the range of laser weapons independent of focal size. Shorter wavelengths provide greater range. Combined with focal size, this determines a laser's overall capability.

Wavelength progression:

- Infrared
- Near Infrared
- Visible Light
- Near Ultraviolet
- Ultraviolet
- Far Ultraviolet
- Soft X-Ray
- X-Ray
- Far X-Ray
- Gamma Ray
- Far Gamma Ray

**Particle Beam Technology:**
An alternative to lasers, particle beams:

- Ignore shields (damage passes through to armour)
- Have shorter range than equivalent lasers
- Deal consistent damage regardless of range (no damage fall-off)
- Ideal for anti-shield opponents

**Meson Technology:**
Meson weapons are a specialized energy weapon type that:

- Ignore both shields AND armour (damage goes directly to internal components)
- Have shorter range and lower raw damage than lasers
- Are extremely effective against heavily armoured targets
- Cannot be defended against conventionally (only speed/ECM/cloaking help)

**Plasma Carronade:**
Short-range, high-damage energy weapons:

- Devastating at close range
- Very short effective range
- Ideal for ambush tactics or point-blank combat
- Cannot be used at stand-off range

**Microwave Weapons:**
Specialised weapons that disrupt electronics:

- Damage enemy fire control and sensor systems
- Do not destroy ships directly
- Useful for disabling enemies rather than destroying them
- Effective against automated defences

**Strategic Significance:**

Energy weapons offer sustained fire without ammunition concerns. Choose your energy weapon specialty based on your tactical doctrine:

- Lasers: Versatile, long-range, well-rounded. The default choice for most empires.
- Particle beams: Anti-shield specialist. Effective against shield-heavy opponents.
- Mesons: The ultimate penetrator. Slow to research but devastatingly effective.
- Plasma carronades: Close-range alpha strike doctrine. High risk, high reward.

> **Tip:** Laser technology (focal size + wavelength) is the most versatile energy weapon investment and works well in almost any situation. Specialised weapons (mesons, plasma) are powerful but situational. Start with lasers unless you have a specific reason to specialise.

## 7.4.5 Kinetic Weapons

Kinetic Weapons research provides railguns, gauss cannons, and other projectile-based weapons that fire physical projectiles at high velocity.

**Key Technology Lines:**

**Railgun Technology:**
Railguns fire magnetically accelerated projectiles:

- Medium range (between missiles and lasers typically)
- High rate of fire
- Damage scales with velocity technology
- No ammunition concerns (powered by ship reactor)
- Good all-around combat weapon

**Gauss Cannon Technology:**
Gauss cannons are specialised rapid-fire weapons designed primarily for point defence:

- Very high rate of fire
- Short range
- Low per-shot damage but high sustained DPS at close range
- Primary role: intercepting incoming missiles
- Essential for any empire facing missile-heavy opponents

**Railgun Velocity:**
Increases the speed (and thus damage) of railgun projectiles. Each level provides a significant damage increase.

**Gauss Cannon Rate of Fire:**
Increases the shots per minute of gauss cannons, improving their effectiveness at intercepting missiles and engaging small craft.

**Strategic Significance:**

Kinetic weapons serve two distinct roles:
1. **Railguns as primary weapons:** Medium-range combat weapons that combine good damage with no ammunition requirements. Effective against most targets.
2. **Gauss cannons as point defence:** Essential for missile interception. Almost every empire needs some gauss cannon technology regardless of their primary weapon doctrine.

The point defence role makes kinetic weapon research important even for empires focused on energy weapons or missiles. Gauss cannons (along with CIWS -- Close-In Weapon Systems) are the primary defence against incoming missiles.

> **Tip:** Even if your primary doctrine is energy weapons or missiles, invest in at least basic gauss cannon technology for point defence. A fleet without point defence is extremely vulnerable to missile attack, which is one of the most common threats you will face.

## 7.4.6 Logistics and Ground Combat

Logistics and Ground Combat research covers crew, ground forces, supply systems, and various support technologies.

**Key Technology Lines:**

**Crew Grade/Training:**
Improves the quality of ship crews, affecting:

- Damage control efficiency (crew repair damage faster)
- Weapon accuracy (better-trained gunners)
- Overall ship performance in combat
- Crew morale and reliability

**Ground Combat Technology:**
Improves ground force effectiveness (see [Section 13.1 Unit Types and Formation Design](../13-ground-forces/13.1-unit-types.md)):

- Weapon strength for ground units
- Armour/protection for ground troops
- Unit organisation and combat efficiency
- Determines the outcome of planetary invasions

**Garrison/Fortification:**
Provides defensive bonuses for ground forces on planets:

- Fortification strength multipliers
- Defensive position effectiveness
- Makes planetary invasion more costly for attackers

**Supply and Maintenance:**
Improves logistical capabilities:

- Reduces maintenance facility requirements for fleets
- Extends operational range before requiring resupply
- Improves reliability of deployed forces

**Jump Drive Technology:**
Unlocks the ability to build jump drives for ships (see [Section 4.4 Jump Points](../4-systems-and-bodies/4.4-jump-points.md)):

- Standard jump drives allow individual ships to transit jump points without gates.
- Jump gate construction technology allows building permanent gates for all ships to use.
- Military jump drives (smaller but less efficient) for warships.
- Commercial jump drives (larger but more efficient) for civilian vessels.
- Squadron jump drives allow one ship to "jump" an entire fleet through a jump point.

**Strategic Significance:**

This category has two critical elements:
1. **Jump drive technology** is essential for interstellar expansion. Without jump-capable ships, you cannot transit jump points (except through existing gates).
2. **Ground combat technology** determines whether you can conquer enemy colonies or defend your own against invasion.

Jump drive research is particularly time-critical: you need it to explore and expand beyond your home system, and the prerequisite chain can be long.

> **Tip:** Jump drive technology should be an early research priority unless you are playing a single-system game. The ability to build jump-capable survey ships and eventually jump gates is fundamental to interstellar expansion. Do not neglect this -- being trapped in your home system while neighbours expand is a losing position.

## 7.4.7 Missiles and Energy Torpedoes

Missiles and Energy Torpedoes research provides the technology for guided weapons -- long-range ordnance that can be launched from beyond beam weapon range.

**Key Technology Lines:**

**Missile Launcher Technology:**
Improves missile launcher size, reload rate, and capacity:

- Each level allows smaller launchers for the same missile size (or larger missiles from the same launcher)
- Faster reload rates mean more missiles fired per minute
- Reduced launcher size means more launchers per ship

**Missile Engine Technology:**
Determines missile speed and range:

- Faster missiles are harder to intercept with point defence
- Longer-range missiles can engage targets from greater stand-off distance
- Speed also affects missile agility (ability to track manoeuvring targets)
- Different engine sizes available for different missile roles

**Warhead Technology:**
Determines damage per missile:

- Higher warhead tech = more damage per hit
- Affects both anti-ship and anti-missile warheads
- Larger warheads consume more missile internal space
- Balance between warhead size, engine size, and fuel for range

**Missile Agility:**
Determines how well missiles track manoeuvring targets:

- Higher agility = better chance to hit fast-moving ships
- Critical against small, fast targets (fighters, FACs)
- Low-agility missiles may miss nimble targets entirely

**Energy Torpedo Technology:**
Energy torpedoes are an alternative to physical missiles:

- Use energy weapons technology for their warhead (no mineral cost per shot beyond construction)
- Generally slower than physical missiles
- No magazine explosion risk (physical missile magazines can detonate if hit)
- Fewer but more powerful shots compared to missile salvos

**Active/Passive Missile Sensors:**
Missiles need sensors to find and track their targets:

- Active sensors emit and detect returns (longer range, but target knows it is being targeted)
- Passive sensors detect emissions (stealthy, but dependent on target emitting)
- Larger/better sensors improve missile accuracy at range
- Sensor size trades off against warhead, engine, and fuel space

**Strategic Significance:**

Missiles are the longest-range weapon system in Aurora and define the stand-off engagement doctrine:

- Missile-heavy fleets engage at extreme range, potentially destroying enemies before they can return fire.
- Disadvantages: ammunition-dependent (magazines must be restocked), vulnerable to point defence, requires ordnance factories and mineral investment for each missile.
- Advantages: extreme range, massed salvos can overwhelm point defence, fire-and-forget capability.

**Missile Design:**

Missiles in Aurora are custom-designed using the Missile Design window. Each missile balances:

- Warhead size (damage)
- Engine size (speed)
- Fuel (range)
- Sensor (accuracy at range)
- Agility (ability to hit manoeuvring targets)
- Total missile size (must fit the launcher)

This design flexibility means missile technology investments translate into increasingly capable custom ordnance.

> **Tip:** Missiles are a "whole system" weapon -- you need launchers, missile engines, warheads, sensors, AND point defence research (to protect against enemy missiles). Going missile-heavy is a significant R&D investment across multiple tech lines, but the stand-off range advantage can be decisive.

## 7.4.8 Power and Propulsion

Power and Propulsion research provides the engines and reactors that move your ships and power their systems. This is arguably the most universally important research category.

**Key Technology Lines:**

**Engine Technology:**
The primary determinant of ship speed. Each engine technology level provides dramatically better power-to-weight ratio:

- Higher engine tech = faster ships
- Speed determines strategic mobility (getting fleets where they need to be)
- Speed determines tactical advantage (faster ships can dictate engagement range)
- Faster ships are harder to hit with low-agility weapons

Engine progression (each roughly doubling the previous):

- Nuclear Thermal → Nuclear Pulse → Ion → Magneto-Plasma → Internal Confinement Fusion → Magnetic Confinement Fusion → Inertial Confinement Fusion → Solid Core Anti-Matter → Gas Core Anti-Matter → Plasma Core Anti-Matter → Beam Core Anti-Matter → Photonic

**Engine Power vs. Fuel Efficiency:**
Within each engine tech level, you can trade fuel efficiency for raw power (or vice versa):

- High power multiplier: Ships are faster but consume fuel quickly.
- High efficiency: Ships are slower but have much greater operational range.
- The optimal balance depends on your strategic situation and logistics capability.

**Reactor Technology:**
Provides power for ship systems (weapons, shields, sensors, etc.):

- Each reactor tech level provides more power per ton of reactor.
- Weapons and shields have minimum power requirements -- insufficient reactor capacity means you cannot mount them.
- Higher reactor tech allows smaller ships to carry powerful weapons.

**Fuel Efficiency Technology:**
Reduces the fuel consumption of engines at a given power output:

- Critical for long-range operations
- Reduces logistical burden (fewer tanker runs)
- Allows smaller fuel tanks on ships, freeing space for other systems

**Power Boost (Max Power Multiplier):**
Determines how much you can increase engine power at the cost of fuel efficiency:

- Higher max power = option for faster ships (at greater fuel cost)
- Does not force you to use maximum power, just increases the upper limit

**Strategic Significance:**

Power and Propulsion is critical for every empire because:

- Every ship needs engines (no engines = no mobility)
- Every weapon system needs reactor power
- Engine tech determines whether you can run from (or catch) enemies
- Speed is both a strategic and tactical advantage
- The technology line is very long (12+ levels) so starting early is essential

This category should almost always have at least one scientist assigned to it throughout the game.

> **Tip:** Engine technology is the single most impactful combat technology you can research. A fleet two engine tech levels ahead of an enemy can dictate engagement range, chase down fleeing ships, and escape unfavourable battles. Prioritize engines above almost everything else if you expect combat.

## 7.4.9 Sensors and Fire Control

Sensors and Fire Control research provides the detection and targeting systems that find enemies and direct weapons against them.

**Key Technology Lines:**

**Active Sensor Strength:**
Determines the detection range of active sensors (sensors that emit signals):

- Higher strength = longer detection range
- Active sensors reveal your location while operating (the enemy knows they are being scanned)
- Essential for detecting incoming threats at range
- Each level significantly increases maximum detection range

**Active Sensor Resolution:**
Determines what size of object the sensor can detect:

- Resolution must match or exceed target size for detection
- Higher resolution sensors can detect smaller objects (missiles, fighters, FACs)
- Trade-off: high-resolution sensors are larger and consume more tonnage
- Typical fleet sensors: set resolution to detect expected enemy ship sizes

**Passive Sensor (EM Detection):**
Detects electromagnetic emissions from ships and installations:

- Does not reveal your location (passive = listening only)
- Range depends on target's EM signature (active sensors, shields, etc.)
- Essential for stealthy operations and early warning
- Larger targets with active sensors are detected at greater range

**Passive Sensor (Thermal Detection):**
Detects thermal (heat) emissions from ships:

- All ships with engines emit thermal signatures when moving
- Does not reveal your location
- Range depends on target's thermal output (engine power level)
- Complements EM detection for full passive awareness

**Fire Control Range:**
Determines the maximum range at which beam weapons can engage targets:

- Weapons cannot fire beyond their fire control's maximum range, regardless of weapon capability
- Fire control range must match or exceed weapon range for full effectiveness
- Higher levels extend engagement envelopes

**Fire Control Accuracy (Tracking Speed):**
Determines accuracy against targets at various speeds:

- Higher tracking speed = better accuracy against fast targets
- Critical for engaging small, fast ships (fighters, FACs)
- Low tracking speed fire controls may miss fast targets entirely
- Must be matched to expected engagement targets

**Missile Fire Control:**
Specialised fire control for missile systems:

- Determines the range at which missiles can be launched with guidance
- Affects missile initial guidance accuracy
- Higher levels allow engagement at greater stand-off ranges

**ECM/ECCM:**
Electronic warfare capabilities:

- ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures): Reduces enemy targeting accuracy
- ECCM (Electronic Counter-Counter-Measures): Resists enemy ECM
- The ECM vs. ECCM competition determines effective hit rates in combat
- Higher ECM levels make your ships harder to hit; higher ECCM makes your weapons more accurate against ECM-equipped enemies

**Strategic Significance:**

Sensors and Fire Control determine three critical capabilities:
1. **Detection range:** How far away you can spot enemies (who sees whom first often determines the battle).
2. **Engagement range:** How far away your weapons can effectively engage.
3. **Accuracy:** How likely your weapons are to hit, especially against fast or ECM-equipped targets.

The interaction between sensors, fire control, and weapons is crucial:

- A powerful laser with short-range fire control cannot engage at its full potential range.
- A long-range sensor with short-range weapons detects enemies it cannot yet shoot.
- Fast enemies require high tracking speed fire control regardless of weapon type.

**Sensor Design:**

Like missiles, sensors in Aurora are custom-designed (see [Section 8.4 Sensors](../8-ship-design/8.4-sensors.md) and [Section 11.1 Thermal and EM Signatures](../11-sensors-and-detection/11.1-thermal-em-signatures.md)):

- You choose the resolution, range, and purpose of each sensor.
- Active sensors can be tuned for different target sizes.
- Multiple sensors on one ship provide different capabilities (one for long-range detection, one for missile tracking, etc.).
- Sensor design interacts with ship design -- large sensors require significant tonnage.

> **Tip:** Ensure your sensor range exceeds your weapon range, and your fire control range matches your weapon range. A common mistake is mounting powerful weapons with inadequate fire control, resulting in weapons that can only engage at a fraction of their theoretical range. Check all three values (sensor range, fire control range, weapon range) during ship design.
