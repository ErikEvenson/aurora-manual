# 7.1 Technology Tree

Research is the engine of progress in Aurora C#. Every improvement to your ships, weapons, engines, sensors, and industrial capacity comes through technological advancement. The technology tree is vast, branching, and full of strategic choices that shape the character of your empire.

## 7.1.1 Tech Structure

Aurora's technology tree is organized into nine major research categories, each containing dozens of individual technologies. Technologies within a category form chains of increasing capability, where each new level builds upon the previous one.

**Category-Based Organization:**

Technologies are grouped by function:
1. Biology and Genetics
2. Construction and Production
3. Defensive Systems
4. Energy Weapons
5. Kinetic Weapons
6. Logistics and Ground Combat
7. Missiles and Energy Torpedoes
8. Power and Propulsion
9. Sensors and Fire Control

Each category contains multiple technology lines -- sequences of related technologies of increasing power and cost.

**Technology Levels:**

Within each technology line, individual technologies represent discrete improvements. For example, the engine technology line might progress through:
- Conventional Engine (starting tech)
- Nuclear Thermal Engine
- Nuclear Pulse Engine
- Ion Drive
- Magneto-Plasma Drive
- Internal Confinement Fusion
- Magnetic Confinement Fusion
- Inertial Confinement Fusion
- Solid Core Anti-Matter
- Gas Core Anti-Matter
- Plasma Core Anti-Matter
- Beam Core Anti-Matter
- Photonic Drive

Each level typically doubles or significantly improves upon the previous one.

**Branching:**

Some technology lines branch, offering different specialization paths. For example, weapon technologies may branch into different weapon types (lasers vs. particle beams vs. masers), each with its own progression chain.

**Independent Lines:**

Not all technologies in a category are sequential. A category may contain several independent technology lines that can be researched in parallel. For example, within Defensive Systems you might research armour technology independently from shield technology.

> **Tip:** Study the technology tree early in your game to plan a coherent research strategy. Random research leads to mediocre capabilities across the board. Focused research in key areas creates decisive advantages sooner.

## 7.1.2 Prerequisite Chains

Most technologies have prerequisites -- earlier technologies that must be researched before the new one becomes available. These prerequisites create the "tree" structure, with early, cheap technologies unlocking access to later, more expensive ones.

**How Prerequisites Work:**

- Each technology lists its required prerequisite(s) in the research window.
- A technology cannot be assigned to a research lab until all its prerequisites are complete.
- Some technologies have multiple prerequisites from different categories (cross-category requirements).
- A few technologies have no prerequisites and are available from game start.

**Key Research Paths:**

Several research paths are particularly important for early development:

**Engine Path (Power and Propulsion):**
Drives all ship speed improvements. Higher engine technology means faster ships, which translates directly into strategic mobility and tactical advantage. Each engine tech level roughly doubles engine power per unit size.

**Reactor Path (Power and Propulsion):**
Provides power for ship systems. Higher reactor technology means more power in less space, enabling more capable ship designs with advanced weapons and sensors.

**Weapon Paths (Energy Weapons / Kinetic Weapons / Missiles):**
These branch into specialized weapon types. Choose your doctrine early:
- Energy weapons (lasers, particle beams) for sustained close-range fire
- Kinetic weapons (railguns, gauss cannons) for point defence and close combat
- Missiles for long-range stand-off engagement

**Construction Rate (Construction and Production):**
Increases factory output per year. Early investment here accelerates all subsequent construction, creating compound economic benefits.

**Mining Production (Construction and Production):**
Increases per-mine mineral output. Similar compound benefits to construction rate.

**Cross-Category Dependencies:**

Some advanced technologies require research from multiple categories. For example:
- Advanced missile warheads may require both missile technology and energy weapon research.
- Some sensor improvements require both sensor technology and power/propulsion advances.
- Jump point theory requires specific physics research before jump drive components become available.

**Planning Ahead:**

Because prerequisites form long chains, starting a research path late means potentially decades of catch-up before you reach useful technologies. Key strategic decisions to make early:
- What is your primary weapon doctrine? (This determines which weapon category to prioritize.)
- Will you focus on speed or armour? (Affects Power and Propulsion vs. Defensive Systems priority.)
- How quickly do you need to expand? (Affects Construction and Production priority.)

> **Tip:** Research the prerequisite chains for your desired endgame technologies and work backwards. If you want Beam Core Anti-Matter engines, you need to start the engine tech line early because there are 12+ levels to research. A mid-game decision to switch from missiles to beam weapons means years of catching up on energy weapon prerequisites.

## 7.1.3 Tech Costs

Each technology has a research point (RP) cost that determines how long it takes to research given your current research capacity. Costs escalate significantly with each technology level.

**Cost Scaling:**

Technology costs in Aurora scale exponentially within each technology line. Early technologies might cost a few hundred RP, while advanced technologies in the same line can cost tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of RP. This exponential scaling means each successive level takes proportionally longer to research, even as your research capacity grows.

**Example Cost Progression (approximate):**

| Technology Level | Typical RP Cost Range |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Level 1 (Starting) | 500 - 2,000 |
| Level 2-3 | 2,000 - 5,000 |
| Level 4-5 | 5,000 - 20,000 |
| Level 6-7 | 20,000 - 50,000 |
| Level 8-10 | 50,000 - 200,000 |
| Level 11+ | 200,000+ |

(Actual costs vary by technology line; some lines have steeper scaling than others.)

**Research Point Generation:**

Research points are generated by:
- Research labs (ground installations) -- each lab generates base RP per year
- Scientist bonus -- the assigned scientist's skill multiplies lab output
- Number of labs assigned to the project -- more labs = faster research (with diminishing returns beyond the scientist's lab cap)

**Research Time Calculation:**

Time to complete = RP Cost / (Labs assigned x RP per lab per year x Scientist bonus)

The number of labs a scientist can effectively supervise is limited by their administration rating. Labs beyond this cap still contribute but at a reduced rate.

**Cost Reduction Technologies:**

There are no technologies that directly reduce research costs. However, improved research lab technology (in the Construction and Production category) increases the RP output per lab, effectively reducing the time required for any given research project.

**Strategic Implications of Cost Scaling:**

- Early technologies provide the best "bang for the buck" -- large capability improvements for modest investment.
- The last few levels of any technology line require enormous investment for incremental improvement.
- It is usually better to have broad technological coverage (level 5 in many areas) than extreme depth (level 12 in one area, level 1 in others).
- Exception: your primary weapon and engine technologies benefit from deep investment because these are your combat differentiators.

> **Tip:** Track your research completion times. If a project will take 30+ years to complete, consider whether that scientist and those labs might produce more total value researching two or three shorter projects instead. The opportunity cost of very long research projects is substantial.
