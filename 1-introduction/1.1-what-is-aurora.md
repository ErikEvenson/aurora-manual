# 1.1 What is Aurora

Aurora 4X is a deeply detailed space strategy game created by Steve Walmsley. It simulates the full scope of interstellar expansion — from researching propulsion technologies and designing warships to colonizing alien worlds and fighting tactical space battles.

## 1.1.1 Genre and Scope

Aurora belongs to the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate), but it pushes far beyond what most 4X games attempt. Where typical strategy games abstract logistics, crew management, and ship design into simple sliders or tech trees, Aurora models these systems with granular precision.

The game covers:

- **Research and Technology**: Hundreds of individual technologies across dozens of fields, from engine design and armor materials to sensors and missile warheads (see [Section 7.1 Technology Tree](../7-research/7.1-technology-tree.md)). Each breakthrough unlocks new component designs and strategic possibilities.
- **Ship Design**: You design every ship from the keel up, selecting engines, armor, weapons, sensors, fuel tanks, cargo holds, and crew facilities (see [Section 8.1 Design Philosophy](../8-ship-design/8.1-design-philosophy.md)). A destroyer is not a unit you build from a menu — it is an engineering project you create.
- **Ground Forces**: Infantry, armor, and support units can be designed, trained, transported, and deployed for planetary invasions or garrison duty (see [Section 13.1 Unit Types and Formation Design](../13-ground-forces/13.1-unit-types.md)).
- **Colonization and Terraforming**: Worlds have detailed atmospheric compositions, gravity, and temperature. Colonies must be established, supplied, and potentially terraformed over decades to become habitable.
- **Exploration**: Jump points connect star systems in a web you must discover through dedicated survey vessels (see [Section 17.1 Geological Survey](../17-exploration/17.1-geological-survey.md)). Each new system may contain resources, habitable worlds, alien ruins, or hostile civilizations.
- **Diplomacy and Espionage**: Interact with other spacefaring races through trade, diplomacy, or intelligence operations (see [Section 15.1 Alien Races](../15-diplomacy/15.1-alien-races.md)).
- **Tactical Combat**: Battles resolve at the individual weapon mount level, with missile volleys, beam weapon engagements, and point defense all modeled in detail (see [Section 12.1 Fire Controls](../12-combat/12.1-fire-controls.md)).

Aurora is often compared to Dwarf Fortress in its depth and complexity. It is not a casual game — it rewards players who enjoy mastering intricate systems and crafting emergent narratives from the simulation's output.

**Scale**: A single game can span centuries of in-game time, encompassing dozens of star systems, hundreds of ships, and billions of colonists. The simulation runs in discrete time increments (from 5 seconds to 30 days), allowing you to manage everything from individual missile salvos to decades-long terraforming projects.

## 1.1.2 History

Aurora's development stretches back over two decades and represents one person's sustained vision for the ultimate space strategy simulation.

**VB6 Era (2003-2016)**: The original Aurora was written in Visual Basic 6 and used a Microsoft Access database as its backend. Despite the aging technology stack, this version accumulated an enormous feature set and a dedicated community. The VB6 version reached a remarkably complete state but was limited by its platform — it could only run on Windows, struggled with large games, and the Access database imposed performance constraints.

**C# Rewrite (2016-present)**: Steve Walmsley undertook a ground-up rewrite in C# with a SQLite database backend. The C# version (sometimes called "Aurora C#" or "Aurora 2") launched publicly in 2020 and brought significant improvements:

- Dramatically improved performance, especially for large games with many NPR (Non-Player Races)
- A proper windowed interface replacing the VB6 tabbed form approach
- Enhanced AI for computer-controlled races
- Improved ground combat and diplomatic systems
- Better stability and reduced database corruption issues
- No dependency on Microsoft Access

**Development Philosophy**: Aurora is developed entirely by Steve Walmsley as a personal project, released for free. There is no monetization, no microtransactions, and no commercial pressure. Updates arrive when they are ready, and the game's design reflects one person's coherent vision rather than a committee's compromises. This results in remarkable depth but also means the interface prioritizes function over visual polish.

## 1.1.3 Community

Aurora has cultivated a passionate community despite (or perhaps because of) its complexity and niche appeal.

**Aurora Forums** (http://aurora2.pentarch.org/): The primary hub for Aurora discussion, hosted on Steve Walmsley's own forum. This is where patch notes are posted, mechanics are discussed, and after-action reports (AARs) are shared. Steve actively participates in discussions and often implements community suggestions.

Key forum sections include:

- **C# Aurora Changes List**: Patch notes and development updates
- **C# Aurora Suggestions**: Community feature requests
- **C# Aurora Bug Reports**: Issue tracking
- **Academy**: Tutorials and guides written by experienced players
- **Fiction**: After-action reports and narrative playthroughs

**Reddit** (r/aurora4x and r/aurora): Active subreddits with beginner questions, gameplay discussions, screenshots, and links to community resources. A good starting point for new players looking for quick answers.

**Discord**: Community-run Discord servers provide real-time help and discussion. These are particularly useful for getting immediate answers to gameplay questions.

**Community Resources**:

- **Aurora Wiki**: Community-maintained wiki with mechanics documentation
- **YouTube Tutorials**: Several community members produce video tutorials and let's-play series
- **Quill18's Aurora Series**: One of the more well-known video introductions to the game
- **Community Spreadsheets**: Players have created various spreadsheets and calculators for ship design optimization, mineral planning, and other complex tasks

**After-Action Reports (AARs)**: One of the community's great traditions is the detailed AAR — a narrative account of a player's game, complete with screenshots, fleet compositions, and dramatic battle reports. These serve both as entertainment and as learning resources for new players, demonstrating strategies and mechanics in context.
