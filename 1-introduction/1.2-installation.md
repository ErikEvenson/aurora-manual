# 1.2 Installation

*Updated: v2026.01.30*

## 1.2.1 System Requirements

*Updated: v2026.01.30*

Aurora C# is not a graphically demanding game, but its simulation engine can be CPU-intensive during large game processing. The following are the practical requirements:

**Minimum Requirements:**

- **Operating System**: Windows only (Windows 7 or later; 64-bit recommended) \hyperlink{ref-1.2-inst-1}{[1]}
- **Runtime**: .NET Framework 4.0 or later \hyperlink{ref-1.2-inst-8}{[8]}; Windows 10+ includes compatible versions
- **CPU**: Any modern processor; faster single-thread performance helps with turn processing *(unverified — [#704](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/704) -- no official CPU requirements published)*
- **RAM**: 4 GB minimum; 8 GB recommended for large games with many NPRs *(unverified — [#704](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/704) -- no official RAM requirements published)*
- **Disk Space**: Approximately 130 MB for the base installation \hyperlink{ref-1.2-inst-2}{[2]}; save databases can grow significantly in long games due to accumulated game events and entity tracking \hyperlink{ref-1.2-inst-6}{[6]}
- **Display**: Minimum 1440x900 required; 1920x1080 or higher recommended \hyperlink{ref-1.2-inst-3}{[3]}

**Performance Notes:**

- Turn processing time scales with the number of active ships, populations, and NPRs. Games with many active NPRs will take noticeably longer to process each increment, primarily because NPR battles trigger extensive combat calculations \hyperlink{ref-1.2-inst-7}{[7]}.
- CPU-bound simulation calculations are the primary bottleneck for very large games \hyperlink{ref-1.2-inst-7}{[7]}. Database bloat from accumulated game events (especially combat logs) is a secondary performance concern that can be mitigated with the SQLite VACUUM command \hyperlink{ref-1.2-inst-6}{[6]}.
- The system map is rendered in software; extremely large fleets in a single system can slow map rendering. *(unverified — [#704](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/704))*

**Non-Windows Users:**
Aurora C# is a Windows application built on .NET Framework and Windows Forms. Linux and macOS users have reported success running Aurora through Wine or Proton, though this is not officially supported. Common issues include font rendering and occasional UI glitches. The community forums have threads dedicated to Linux/Wine compatibility with specific configuration tips. *(unverified — [#704](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/704) -- Wine/Proton compatibility details are community-reported and vary by configuration)*

> **Tip:** For Linux/Wine setup guidance, search the Aurora Forums ([aurora2.pentarch.org](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/)) for "Wine" or "Linux" in the C# Aurora section. Community members have documented working configurations including Wine version requirements and winetricks packages needed for .NET Framework support.

## 1.2.2 Downloading Aurora

*Updated: v2026.01.30*

Aurora C# is distributed for free through the official Aurora forums.

**Official Download Location:**

1. Visit the Aurora Forums at https://aurora2.pentarch.org/
2. Navigate to the **C# Aurora** > **Installation** board, or go directly to: https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?board=276.0
3. Look for the pinned download thread, which contains the base version and all subsequent patches
4. The game is distributed as RAR (.rar) archives. Windows 11 can extract RAR files natively; on older versions of Windows, use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or WinRAR.

**Version Numbering**: Aurora uses a version numbering scheme (e.g., 2.7.1). Steve Walmsley posts changelogs with each release in the C# Aurora Changes List section. There is no auto-update mechanism — you must manually download new versions.

**Patching Process**: Aurora uses an incremental patching model. The base installation package is v1.13.0 \hyperlink{ref-1.2-inst-4}{[4]}, with patches applied in sequence. Alternatively, a pre-patched full installation package (currently v2.7.1) is available that includes all patches applied \hyperlink{ref-1.2-inst-2}{[2]}. Each patch only contains what changed — typically a new `Aurora.exe` and/or a fresh `AuroraDB.db` — and is applied on top of the previous version.

**Warning — Database Overwrites**: Patches that include an `AuroraDB.db` file will overwrite your existing database. Since the database IS your save game, always back up your `AuroraDB.db` before applying any patch. After patching, you can restore your backed-up database to continue an existing game (unless the changelog states the new database is required for compatibility).

**Important**: Always download from the official forum thread. There is no other official distribution channel (no Steam, no third-party download sites). Versions found elsewhere may be outdated or modified.

## 1.2.3 Setup and Configuration

*Updated: v2026.01.30*

Aurora does not use an installer. Setup consists of extracting files and running the executable.

> **Warning:** Aurora requires US/UK number formatting (period as decimal separator, comma as thousands separator) \hyperlink{ref-1.2-inst-5}{[5]}. If your system locale uses a different convention (e.g., comma as decimal separator, as is common in many European countries), the game will have "a multitude of issues." You must change your Windows regional format settings to English (United States) or English (United Kingdom) before running Aurora.

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Extract the RAR archive**: Extract the downloaded `.rar` file to a location of your choice. Avoid `Program Files` or other protected directories, as Aurora needs write access to its own folder for the database files. A location like `C:\Games\Aurora` or `C:\Aurora` works well.

2. **Verify Contents**: After extraction, your Aurora folder should contain:
   - `Aurora.exe` — The main executable
   - `AuroraDB.db` — The SQLite database (this is your save file)
   - Various `.dll` files — Runtime dependencies
   - `Maps` folder — Star system map images (optional)
   - `Flags` folder — Race flag images
   - Other supporting files and folders

3. **First Run**: Simply double-click `Aurora.exe` to launch. No additional configuration is required for a basic start.

**Database Location**: The `AuroraDB.db` file in the Aurora folder is your game's database. This single file contains all game state — stars, planets, ships, races, everything. This is both your save file and the active game state.

**Backup Strategy**: Since all game data lives in `AuroraDB.db`, backing up your game is as simple as copying this file. It is strongly recommended to make regular backups, especially before updating to a new version. A good practice:

- Copy `AuroraDB.db` to a backup location before each play session
- Name backups with the in-game date (e.g., `AuroraDB_2050-01-01.db`)
- Keep at least 2-3 rolling backups in case corruption is not immediately noticed

**Applying a Patch**: When a new patch is released:
1. **Back up** your current `AuroraDB.db` (this is your save game — patches may overwrite it)
2. Extract the patch RAR into your existing Aurora folder, overwriting files when prompted
3. If the patch included a new `AuroraDB.db` and you want to continue your existing game, copy your backed-up database back into the folder
4. Check Steve's changelog to confirm whether the new database is required for compatibility (in which case you must start fresh or use the provided database)

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

- **"Application failed to start"**: Ensure .NET Framework 4.0 or later is installed \hyperlink{ref-1.2-inst-8}{[8]}. Windows 10 and later include compatible versions. Download from Microsoft if needed on older systems.
- **"Database is locked"**: Only one instance of Aurora can access the database at a time. Close any other running instances.
- **UI elements cut off**: Ensure Windows display scaling is set to 100%, or experiment with the application's DPI compatibility settings (right-click Aurora.exe > Properties > Compatibility > Change high DPI settings).
- **Incorrect values or game-breaking calculation errors**: Ensure your Windows regional format is set to English (United States) or English (United Kingdom). Aurora requires a period (.) as the decimal separator. Other locale settings cause the game to misparse numerical values.
- **Slow startup**: The initial load reads the entire database. Large games with extensive history will take longer to load.
