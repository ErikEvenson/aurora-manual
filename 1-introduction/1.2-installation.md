# 1.2 Installation

## 1.2.1 System Requirements

Aurora C# is not a graphically demanding game, but its simulation engine can be CPU-intensive during large game processing. The following are the practical requirements:

**Minimum Requirements:**
- **Operating System**: Windows 7 or later (64-bit recommended)
- **Runtime**: .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later (included with Windows 10 and later)
- **CPU**: Any modern processor; faster single-thread performance helps with turn processing
- **RAM**: 4 GB minimum; 8 GB recommended for large games with many NPRs
- **Disk Space**: Approximately 200 MB for the base installation; save databases can grow to several hundred MB in long games
- **Display**: Minimum 1920x1080 recommended; the interface has many windows with dense information

**Performance Notes:**
- Turn processing time scales with the number of active ships, populations, and NPRs. A game with 10+ active NPRs will take noticeably longer to process each increment.
- SQLite database operations are the primary bottleneck for very large games. Running the game from an SSD provides meaningful improvement.
- The system map is rendered in software; extremely large fleets in a single system can slow map rendering.

**Non-Windows Users:**
Aurora C# is a Windows application built on .NET Framework and Windows Forms. Linux and macOS users have reported success running Aurora through Wine or Proton, though this is not officially supported. Common issues include font rendering and occasional UI glitches. The community forums have threads dedicated to Linux/Wine compatibility with specific configuration tips.

## 1.2.2 Downloading Aurora

Aurora C# is distributed for free through the official Aurora forums.

**Official Download Location:**
1. Visit the Aurora Forums at http://aurora2.pentarch.org/
2. Navigate to the **C# Aurora** section
3. Look for the pinned download thread, which contains the latest version
4. The game is distributed as a ZIP archive

**Version Numbering**: Aurora uses a version numbering scheme (e.g., 2.1.1). Steve Walmsley posts changelogs with each release in the C# Aurora Changes List section. There is no auto-update mechanism — you must manually download new versions.

**Patches**: Some updates are distributed as full replacements (re-download the entire ZIP), while smaller fixes may be distributed as individual file replacements. The changelog post will specify which approach to use.

**Important**: Always download from the official forum thread. There is no other official distribution channel (no Steam, no third-party download sites). Versions found elsewhere may be outdated or modified.

## 1.2.3 Setup and Configuration

Aurora does not use an installer. Setup consists of extracting files and running the executable.

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Extract the ZIP**: Extract the downloaded archive to a location of your choice. Avoid `Program Files` or other protected directories, as Aurora needs write access to its own folder for the database files. A location like `C:\Games\Aurora` or `C:\Aurora` works well.

2. **Verify Contents**: After extraction, your Aurora folder should contain:
   - `Aurora.exe` — The main executable
   - `AuroraDB.db` — The SQLite database (this is your save file)
   - Various `.dll` files — Runtime dependencies
   - `Maps` folder — Star system map images (optional)
   - `Flags` folder — Race flag images
   - Other supporting files and folders

3. **First Run**: Simply double-click `Aurora.exe` to launch. No additional configuration is required for a basic start.

**Database Location**: The `AuroraDB.db` file in the Aurora folder is your game's database. This single file contains all game state — stars, planets, ships, races, everything. This is both your save file and the active game state.

**Backup Strategy**: Since all game data lives in `AuroraDB.db`, backing up your game is as simple as copying this file. It is strongly recommended to make regular backups, especially before updating to a new version. A good practice:
- Copy `AuroraDB.db` to a backup location before each play session
- Name backups with the in-game date (e.g., `AuroraDB_2050-01-01.db`)
- Keep at least 2-3 rolling backups in case corruption is not immediately noticed

**Updating Aurora**: When a new version is released:
1. Back up your current `AuroraDB.db`
2. Extract the new version to a fresh folder (or overwrite the existing installation, but keep your database)
3. Copy your `AuroraDB.db` into the new installation folder if needed
4. Steve's changelog will note if any database migration steps are required (rare, but it happens)

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**
- **"Application failed to start"**: Ensure .NET Framework 4.7.2+ is installed. Download from Microsoft if needed.
- **"Database is locked"**: Only one instance of Aurora can access the database at a time. Close any other running instances.
- **UI elements cut off**: Ensure Windows display scaling is set to 100%, or experiment with the application's DPI compatibility settings (right-click Aurora.exe > Properties > Compatibility > Change high DPI settings).
- **Slow startup**: The initial load reads the entire database. Large games with extensive history will take longer to load.
