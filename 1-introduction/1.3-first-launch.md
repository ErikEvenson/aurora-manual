# 1.3 First Launch

## 1.3.1 Main Menu

When you launch Aurora, you are presented with the main game window. Unlike many games, Aurora does not have a traditional "main menu" screen. Instead, you are immediately in the game interface with access to all controls and windows.

On first launch with a fresh database, there will be no existing game data. The primary actions available are:

- **Create a New Game**: Access through the top menu to set up a new galaxy with your race
- **Open Various Windows**: The toolbar and menus provide access to all game management windows even before a game is started (though most will be empty)
- **SpaceMaster Mode**: A toggle that gives you omniscient control over all races and systems — useful for learning, testing, or managing NPRs manually

**The Aurora Window**: The main window serves as the system map display and primary interface hub. From here you can access every other window in the game through the menu bar or toolbar buttons. The game does not use a tabbed interface like the old VB6 version — instead, each function opens in its own window, allowing you to arrange them however you prefer across your screen (multiple monitors are very helpful).

## 1.3.2 Loading a Game

Aurora's save system works differently from most games. There is no "Save" or "Load" command in the traditional sense.

**How Saving Works:**
- The game database (`AuroraDB.db`) is the live game state
- Changes are written to the database as they happen (when you advance time, make orders, etc.)
- There is no separate save action — the game is always "saved"
- To maintain multiple save points, you must manually copy the database file

**Starting a New Game:**
1. From the menu bar, select the option to create a new game (or access it through the appropriate toolbar button)
2. This takes you through game setup (covered in detail in Section 2)
3. Once created, the game is immediately active

**Switching Between Games:**
Aurora supports multiple games in the same database. If you have created multiple games (races), you can switch between them:
1. Use the race selection to change which race you are currently controlling
2. Each race has its own view of the galaxy, its own ships, colonies, and research

**Restoring a Backup:**
1. Close Aurora completely
2. Replace the current `AuroraDB.db` with your backup copy
3. Restart Aurora
4. The game will load in whatever state the backup represents

**Fresh Start:**
To start completely fresh (erasing all existing game data):
1. Close Aurora
2. Delete or rename the existing `AuroraDB.db`
3. The next launch will create a new empty database (or you can extract a fresh copy from the download ZIP)

## 1.3.3 Quick Start Checklist

For players who want to get into a game as quickly as possible, here is the minimal path from installation to playing:

**Fastest Path to Playing:**

1. **Extract and Launch**: Extract Aurora to a folder, run `Aurora.exe`
2. **Create New Game**: Start the new game creation process from the menu
3. **Accept Defaults**: For your first game, the default settings are reasonable:
   - Use a Trans-Newtonian start (you begin with space age technology)
   - Use Sol as your starting system (familiar reference point)
   - Default race settings are playable (Earth-like species)
4. **Open Key Windows**: Once your game is created, open these windows to get oriented:
   - **System Map**: Your primary view of the star system
   - **Economics**: Shows your colonies, production, and resources
   - **Fleet Window**: Where you manage ships and give movement orders
   - **Research**: Assign scientists to research projects
5. **Advance Time**: Use the time increment buttons to advance the game clock. Nothing happens until you advance time.

**Recommended First Steps in a New Game:**

1. **Survey Your System**: You should have a gravitational survey ship. Set it to survey the system — this reveals jump points to other stars.
2. **Start Research**: Open the Research window, assign your scientists to projects. Early priorities include propulsion (faster ships), construction (build faster), and sensors (see farther).
3. **Build Mines and Factories**: On the Economics window, queue up additional mines (to extract minerals) and construction factories (to build things faster).
4. **Design a Ship**: Once you have some basic tech, open the Ship Design window and try creating a simple vessel — perhaps a fuel harvester or a second survey ship.
5. **Explore**: Once you find jump points, send ships through to discover new systems.

**Tips for New Players:**
- Do not worry about optimizing your first game. Aurora has enormous depth, and your first game is for learning, not winning.
- Use SpaceMaster mode to peek at things if you are confused about what is happening — you can toggle it on to see the full picture, then toggle it off to resume normal play.
- The game will generate events (in the Event Log) when important things happen. Pay attention to these — they are how Aurora communicates with you.
- Time increments matter: use short increments (5 seconds to 30 seconds) during combat, longer increments (days to months) during peacetime development.
- If nothing seems to be happening, you probably need to advance time further. Early game development takes in-game years.
