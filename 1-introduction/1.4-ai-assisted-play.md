# 1.4 AI-Assisted Play

*Added: v2026.01.31*

Aurora's depth creates a paradox: the comprehensive documentation needed to play well can itself become overwhelming. This section describes how to use AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, or similar) as a real-time coach, leveraging this manual as a verified knowledge base.

## 1.4.1 Why AI-Assisted Play Works for Aurora

*Added: v2026.01.31*

Aurora is uniquely suited to AI assistance because:

- **Turn-based pacing**: You can pause indefinitely to consult your AI coach without time pressure
- **Database-driven mechanics**: Most game rules are deterministic formulas that can be precisely explained
- **Dense documentation**: This manual exists specifically to provide AI with verified, citation-backed information
- **Complex interdependencies**: AI excels at explaining how system A affects system B affects system C

AI assistance does not replace learning the game — it accelerates it by providing context-aware guidance when you need it.

## 1.4.2 Setting Up Your AI Coach

*Added: v2026.01.31*

### 1.4.2.1 Providing Context

For best results, give the AI access to this manual. Options include:

- **Direct file access**: Tools like Claude Code can read the manual files directly
- **Repository reference**: Point the AI to the GitHub repository (github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual)
- **Copy relevant sections**: Paste specific manual sections into your conversation when asking about those topics

### 1.4.2.2 Establishing Game State

Begin each session by telling the AI your current situation:

```
I'm playing Aurora C# v2.7.1 with a conventional start.
Current year: 2031
Population: 850 million on Earth
I have 400 construction factories and 200 mines.
I just researched my first engine technology.
```

The more context you provide, the more relevant the AI's guidance will be.

## 1.4.3 Effective Prompting Patterns

*Added: v2026.01.31*

### 1.4.3.1 Situation Assessment

When you're unsure what to focus on:

```
Given my game state [describe], what should my priorities be
for the next 5 years? Reference the manual for recommended
build orders or strategic guidance.
```

### 1.4.3.2 Problem Diagnosis

When something seems wrong:

```
My ships keep running out of fuel before reaching their
destination. What am I doing wrong? Cite relevant manual
sections about fuel consumption and ship design.
```

### 1.4.3.3 Decision Support

When facing a choice:

```
I can build either 50 more mines or 20 more construction
factories. Which is better for my current situation?
Explain the trade-offs using the manual's economy section.
```

### 1.4.3.4 Mechanic Explanation

When you need to understand a system:

```
Explain how maintenance facilities and MSP production work
in C# Aurora. I keep seeing "lack of MSP" warnings.
Cite the manual sections and any relevant database values.
```

### 1.4.3.5 UI Navigation

When you can't find something:

```
I need to design a ground force formation. Which window
do I open and what buttons do I click? Walk me through
the process step by step.
```

## 1.4.4 Session Patterns

*Added: v2026.01.31*

### 1.4.4.1 Pre-Session Briefing

Before playing:

```
I'm about to start a new Aurora session. Last time I:
- Colonized my first moon
- Started building a shipyard
- Detected an NPR 3 jumps away

What should I focus on this session? What threats should
I be watching for?
```

### 1.4.4.2 Mid-Session Consultation

During play, keep the AI conversation open. Ask quick questions as situations arise:

- "An NPR fleet just appeared in my home system. What do I do?"
- "My colony is showing 40% unrest. How do I fix this?"
- "I need to design a missile. What are the key trade-offs?"

### 1.4.4.3 Post-Session Review

After playing:

```
I just finished a session where [describe what happened].
What did I do well? What mistakes did I make? What should
I read in the manual before my next session?
```

## 1.4.5 Verification Habits

*Added: v2026.01.31*

AI assistants can make mistakes. Develop these verification habits:

### 1.4.5.1 Demand Citations

Always ask the AI to cite manual sections:

```
What is the formula for population growth?
Cite the specific manual section and reference number.
```

If the AI cannot cite a source, treat the answer as unverified.

### 1.4.5.2 Cross-Check Critical Values

For important numbers (costs, formulas, tech requirements), verify against:

- The manual's database references
- The in-game tooltips
- The actual game database if you're comfortable with SQLite queries

### 1.4.5.3 Distinguish VB6 from C#

Aurora C# differs significantly from the older VB6 version. If an AI response mentions mechanics that seem unfamiliar, ask:

```
Is this mechanic from VB6 Aurora or C# Aurora?
This manual covers C# only.
```

### 1.4.5.4 Test Before Committing

For strategic advice, test on a small scale before full commitment:

- Build one ship of a new design before queuing ten
- Try a tactic with a single fleet before your entire navy
- Save before major decisions so you can revert if needed

## 1.4.6 What AI Cannot Do

*Added: v2026.01.31*

Understand the limitations:

- **No direct game access**: AI cannot see your game state unless you describe it
- **No real-time updates**: AI doesn't know what happened since you last described your situation
- **Potential hallucination**: AI may confidently state incorrect game mechanics — always verify critical information
- **No substitute for experience**: Reading about missile combat is not the same as fighting a missile duel

AI assistance accelerates learning but does not replace playing the game.

## 1.4.7 Example Coaching Session

*Added: v2026.01.31*

The following illustrates a typical AI-assisted play session:

**Player**: I'm in year 2028, conventional start. I just finished researching Trans-Newtonian Technology. What do I do now?

**AI**: Congratulations — this unlocks the entire TN economy. Your immediate priorities:

1. **Convert Conventional Industry** to dedicated TN installations. Per Section 2.5.1, CI converts at 20 BP each (vs 120 BP to build new). Priority order:
   - Construction Factories (to build more installations faster)
   - Mines (to feed your construction)
   - Fuel Refineries (you'll need fuel for ships)

2. **Research propulsion** — you need engines before you can build useful ships. See Section 7.4 for the engine tech tree.

3. **Don't neglect maintenance** — per Section 14.2.3, Maintenance Facilities produce MSP at 20/year base rate. Build some early or your future fleet will deteriorate.

**Player**: How many construction factories should I aim for?

**AI**: There's no fixed answer, but community convention suggests:
- 400-800 for a comfortable pace
- 1000+ for aggressive expansion

Per Section 6.3, each CF produces 10 BP/year. With 500 CFs, you produce 5,000 BP/year — enough to build roughly 40 mines or a small warship annually.

**Player**: I converted 200 CI to construction factories. Now my mineral stockpiles are dropping fast. Is that normal?

**AI**: Yes — each conversion costs minerals (Section 2.5.1 table). Construction Factories cost 10 Duranium + 10 Neutronium per conversion. With 200 conversions, you spent 2,000 Duranium and 2,000 Neutronium.

Check your mineral stockpiles in the Economics window. If you're running low, prioritize converting some CI to Mines next, or pause conversions until stockpiles recover.

This coaching pattern — situation, guidance, follow-up, adjustment — represents how AI can serve as a knowledgeable companion throughout your Aurora journey.
