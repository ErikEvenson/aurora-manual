# 1.4 AI-Assisted Play

*Updated: v2026.01.31*

Aurora's depth creates a paradox: the comprehensive documentation needed to play well can itself become overwhelming. This section describes how to use AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, or similar) as a real-time coach, leveraging this manual as a verified knowledge base.

## 1.4.1 Why AI-Assisted Play Works for Aurora

*Updated: v2026.01.31*

Aurora is uniquely suited to AI assistance because:

- **Turn-based pacing**: You can pause indefinitely to consult your AI coach without time pressure
- **Database-driven mechanics**: Most game rules are deterministic formulas that can be precisely explained
- **Dense documentation**: This manual exists specifically to provide AI with verified, citation-backed information
- **Complex interdependencies**: AI excels at explaining how system A affects system B affects system C

AI assistance does not replace learning the game — it accelerates it by providing context-aware guidance when you need it.

## 1.4.2 Setting Up Your AI Coach

*Updated: v2026.01.31*

### 1.4.2.1 Providing Context

For best results, give the AI access to this manual. Options include:

- **Direct file access**: Tools like Claude Code can read the manual files directly
- **Repository reference**: Point the AI to the GitHub repository (github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual)
- **Copy relevant sections**: Paste specific manual sections into your conversation when asking about those topics

### 1.4.2.2 Establishing Game State

Begin each session by telling the AI your current situation:

```
I'm playing Aurora C# v2.7.1 with a conventional start.
Current year: 2031
Population: 850 million on Earth
I have 400 construction factories and 200 mines.
I just researched my first engine technology.
```

The more context you provide, the more relevant the AI's guidance will be.

### 1.4.2.3 Direct Database Access

AI assistants with file system access (such as Claude Code) can query your game database directly. The Aurora database (`AuroraDB.db`) is a SQLite file containing all game mechanics, your current game state, and reference data.

**Location**: Typically in your Aurora installation folder (e.g., `~/Downloads/Aurora271Full/AuroraDB.db`)

**What AI can query directly**:

- **Reference tables** (`DIM_*`): Component stats, tech trees, installation costs, mineral requirements
- **Game state** (`FCT_*`): Your ships, colonies, populations, fleets, research progress
- **Tech system** (`FCT_TechSystem`): All technologies with costs, prerequisites, and effects

**Example prompts using database access**:

```
Query my game database and tell me:
- How many construction factories do I have on Earth?
- What technologies have I researched?
- What ships are in my fleet?
```

```
Look up the exact mineral cost for a Fuel Refinery
in DIM_PlanetaryInstallation and tell me what I need.
```

```
Query FCT_TechSystem for all engine technologies and
show me the research progression with costs.
```

**Advantages of direct database access**:

- **Real-time accuracy**: AI sees your actual game state, not your description of it
- **No transcription errors**: Values come directly from the database
- **Deep queries**: AI can correlate data across tables (e.g., "which of my ships are low on fuel?")
- **Verification**: AI can confirm manual claims against the actual game database

**Setup for Claude Code**:

```
My Aurora database is at: ~/Downloads/Aurora271Full/AuroraDB.db
You can query it with sqlite3. Use this for accurate game data.
```

This transforms AI from a coach working from your descriptions to an analyst with direct visibility into your game state.

## 1.4.3 Effective Prompting Patterns

*Updated: v2026.01.31*

### 1.4.3.1 Situation Assessment

When you're unsure what to focus on:

```
Given my game state [describe], what should my priorities be
for the next 5 years? Reference the manual for recommended
build orders or strategic guidance.
```

### 1.4.3.2 Problem Diagnosis

When something seems wrong:

```
My ships keep running out of fuel before reaching their
destination. What am I doing wrong? Cite relevant manual
sections about fuel consumption and ship design.
```

### 1.4.3.3 Decision Support

When facing a choice:

```
I can build either 50 more mines or 20 more construction
factories. Which is better for my current situation?
Explain the trade-offs using the manual's economy section.
```

### 1.4.3.4 Mechanic Explanation

When you need to understand a system:

```
Explain how maintenance facilities and MSP production work
in C# Aurora. I keep seeing "lack of MSP" warnings.
Cite the manual sections and any relevant database values.
```

### 1.4.3.5 UI Navigation

When you can't find something:

```
I need to design a ground force formation. Which window
do I open and what buttons do I click? Walk me through
the process step by step.
```

## 1.4.4 Session Patterns

*Updated: v2026.01.31*

### 1.4.4.1 Pre-Session Briefing

Before playing:

```
I'm about to start a new Aurora session. Last time I:
- Colonized my first moon
- Started building a shipyard
- Detected an NPR 3 jumps away

What should I focus on this session? What threats should
I be watching for?
```

### 1.4.4.2 Mid-Session Consultation

During play, keep the AI conversation open. Ask quick questions as situations arise:

- "An NPR fleet just appeared in my home system. What do I do?"
- "My colony is showing 40% unrest. How do I fix this?"
- "I need to design a missile. What are the key trade-offs?"

### 1.4.4.3 Post-Session Review

After playing:

```
I just finished a session where [describe what happened].
What did I do well? What mistakes did I make? What should
I read in the manual before my next session?
```

## 1.4.5 Verification Habits

*Updated: v2026.01.31*

AI assistants can make mistakes. Develop these verification habits:

### 1.4.5.1 Demand Citations

Always ask the AI to cite manual sections:

```
What is the formula for population growth?
Cite the specific manual section and reference number.
```

If the AI cannot cite a source, treat the answer as unverified.

### 1.4.5.2 Cross-Check Critical Values

For important numbers (costs, formulas, tech requirements), verify against:

- The manual's database references
- The in-game tooltips
- The actual game database if you're comfortable with SQLite queries

### 1.4.5.3 Distinguish VB6 from C#

Aurora C# differs significantly from the older VB6 version. If an AI response mentions mechanics that seem unfamiliar, ask:

```
Is this mechanic from VB6 Aurora or C# Aurora?
This manual covers C# only.
```

### 1.4.5.4 Test Before Committing

For strategic advice, test on a small scale before full commitment:

- Build one ship of a new design before queuing ten
- Try a tactic with a single fleet before your entire navy
- Save before major decisions so you can revert if needed

## 1.4.6 What AI Cannot Do

*Updated: v2026.01.31*

Understand the limitations:

- **No direct game access**: AI cannot see your game state unless you describe it
- **No real-time updates**: AI doesn't know what happened since you last described your situation
- **Potential hallucination**: AI may confidently state incorrect game mechanics — always verify critical information
- **No substitute for experience**: Reading about missile combat is not the same as fighting a missile duel

AI assistance accelerates learning but does not replace playing the game.

## 1.4.7 Example Coaching Session

*Updated: v2026.01.31*

The following illustrates a typical AI-assisted play session:

**Player**: I'm in year 2028, conventional start. I just finished researching Trans-Newtonian Technology. What do I do now?

**AI**: Congratulations — this unlocks the entire TN economy. Your immediate priorities:

1. **Convert Conventional Industry** to dedicated TN installations. Per Section 2.5.1, CI converts at 20 BP each (vs 120 BP to build new). Priority order:
   - Construction Factories (to build more installations faster)
   - Mines (to feed your construction)
   - Fuel Refineries (you'll need fuel for ships)

2. **Research propulsion** — you need engines before you can build useful ships. See Section 7.4 for the engine tech tree.

3. **Don't neglect maintenance** — per Section 14.2.3, Maintenance Facilities produce MSP at 20/year base rate. Build some early or your future fleet will deteriorate.

**Player**: How many construction factories should I aim for?

**AI**: There's no fixed answer, but community convention suggests:
- 400-800 for a comfortable pace
- 1000+ for aggressive expansion

Per Section 6.3, each CF produces 10 BP/year. With 500 CFs, you produce 5,000 BP/year — enough to build roughly 40 mines or a small warship annually.

**Player**: I converted 200 CI to construction factories. Now my mineral stockpiles are dropping fast. Is that normal?

**AI**: Yes — each conversion costs minerals (Section 2.5.1 table). Construction Factories cost 10 Duranium + 10 Neutronium per conversion. With 200 conversions, you spent 2,000 Duranium and 2,000 Neutronium.

Check your mineral stockpiles in the Economics window. If you're running low, prioritize converting some CI to Mines next, or pause conversions until stockpiles recover.

This coaching pattern — situation, guidance, follow-up, adjustment — represents how AI can serve as a knowledgeable companion throughout your Aurora journey.

## 1.4.8 How This Manual Prevents AI Hallucination

*Updated: v2026.01.31*

A common concern with AI-assisted learning is "hallucination" — AI confidently stating incorrect information. This manual is specifically designed to minimize this problem when used as an AI knowledge base.

### 1.4.8.1 Database-Verified References

Every factual claim in this manual includes a numbered reference linking to its source. The primary source is the Aurora game database itself (`AuroraDB.db`), with citations specifying exact table names, column names, and values:

```
Maintenance Facilities produce MSP at a base rate of 20 per year [3].

[3]. Aurora C# game database (AuroraDB.db v2.7.1) — FCT_TechSystem
     TechTypeID=209, AdditionalInfo=20.0, TechDescription="Annual
     production rate for a single maintenance facility"
```

When an AI cites this manual, it is citing database-verified facts, not forum posts, wiki summaries, or community folklore.

### 1.4.8.2 Explicit Uncertainty Marking

Claims that cannot be verified against authoritative sources are explicitly marked:

```
*(unverified — #837, requires live testing)*
```

This marking serves two purposes:
1. It warns human readers that the information needs verification
2. It signals to AI that this specific claim should be treated with lower confidence

When an AI encounters an unverified marker, it can appropriately caveat its response rather than presenting the information as established fact.

### 1.4.8.3 Structural Separation

The manual separates different types of content:

| Content Type | Indicator | AI Should Treat As |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Database-verified facts | `\hyperlink{ref-X.Y-N}{[N]}` citation | High confidence |
| Unverified claims | `*(unverified — #NNN)*` marker | Low confidence, recommend verification |
| Community recommendations | "Tip:" or "community convention" language | Opinion/guidance, not game mechanics |
| Editorial content | Explicitly labeled sections | Author perspective, not game facts |

This structure allows AI to distinguish between "the game works this way" (verifiable) and "players recommend doing this" (subjective).

### 1.4.8.4 Why This Matters

Traditional game documentation sources are problematic for AI:

- **Forum posts** mix accurate information with outdated advice, speculation, and version-specific mechanics
- **Wiki articles** may describe VB6 Aurora mechanics that no longer apply to C# Aurora
- **YouTube tutorials** become outdated as the game updates
- **AI training data** includes all of the above without distinguishing quality

This manual addresses these problems by:

1. **Version pinning**: All references cite the specific database version (currently v2.7.1)
2. **C# focus**: The manual explicitly covers only C# Aurora, eliminating VB6 confusion
3. **Active maintenance**: Unverified claims are tracked via GitHub issues and resolved over time
4. **Testable claims**: Database references can be independently verified by anyone with SQLite access

### 1.4.8.5 Demonstrated Reliability

The manual's anti-hallucination design has been tested against common misconceptions circulating in the Aurora community:

| Claimed "Hallucination" | Manual's Position | Verification |
|------------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| "MSP is produced by Construction Factories" | Section 14.2.3 states Maintenance Facilities produce MSP | Database: FCT_TechSystem TechTypeID=209 confirms "production rate for a single maintenance facility" |
| "Static units use old PDC logic" | Section 13.1.3.6 clearly distinguishes Static Weapons (ground units) from PDCs (Section 12.7, ship-like installations) | Architectural separation verified |

When challenged with "known AI hallucinations," the manual's database-backed citations provide definitive resolution.

### 1.4.8.6 Verification Workflow for AI Users

If you suspect an AI response based on this manual might be incorrect:

1. **Ask for the citation**: "Which manual section and reference number supports that claim?"
2. **Check the reference**: Look up the cited reference in the manual's References section
3. **Verify against the database**: If you have SQLite access, run the query yourself
4. **Check for unverified markers**: If the claim has `*(unverified)*`, treat it as provisional
5. **Report discrepancies**: File a GitHub issue if you find an error — the manual improves through community verification

This workflow transforms AI-assisted play from "trust the AI" to "trust but verify" — with verification made practical by the manual's citation infrastructure.
