# 13.3 Ground Combat

Ground combat in Aurora C# resolves battles between opposing formations on the same planetary body. Combat occurs after each naval phase, with one ground combat round per eight hours of game time. Ground combat activates automatically whenever hostile forces from two or more powers occupy the same system body with populations.

## 13.3.1 Planetary Terrain

Each planet receives a dominant terrain type determined by environmental conditions. Terrain significantly affects combat through fortification modifiers, to-hit penalties, and interactions with unit combat capabilities.

### Terrain Type Determination

**Barren/Mountain Default Rules:**
Worlds meeting any of these conditions default to "Barren" terrain:
- Temperature below -100C or above 200C
- No atmosphere
- Atmospheric pressure exceeding 10 atm

Exception: Worlds with platelet or extreme tectonics receive "Mountain" terrain instead of Barren.

**Other Worlds:** Check environmental compatibility tables to determine eligible terrain types, randomly selected from: Desert, Forest, Jungle, Mountain, Rift Valley, Steppe, Swamp, and combined variants (e.g., Jungle Mountain, Arid Mountain).

### Terrain Effects on Combat

| Terrain Type | Max Fortification | To-Hit Modifier | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Steppe | 6 | 1.0 (no penalty) | Open terrain; no penalty to orbital fire |
| Desert | Varies | Varies | Arid environments |
| Forest | Varies | Varies | Moderate concealment |
| Jungle | High | Low multiplier | Dense vegetation favors defense |
| Mountain | High | Low multiplier | Elevation advantage |
| Jungle Mountain | 18 | 0.125 | Combined terrain; extreme defense |
| Rift Valley | Varies | Varies | Broken terrain |
| Barren | Low | Higher | Minimal concealment |

The fortification modifier from terrain multiplies the element's fortification level. If a formation element's fortification level is greater than 1, it is multiplied by the fortification bonus of the dominant terrain.

### Terraforming Effects on Terrain

Terrain can shift through two mechanisms:
1. **Type Progression:** Worlds with base types (Barren, Mountain, Rift Valley) transition between similar terrain categories as environmental conditions improve through terraforming
2. **Environmental Incompatibility:** Unsuitable terrain regenerates when conditions no longer support current type

### Combat Capabilities vs. Terrain

The game consolidates terrain into three primary combat specialization categories:

- **Mountain Warfare:** Applies to any mountain or rift valley terrain type, including combined terrain (e.g., Jungle Mountain)
- **Desert Warfare:** Covers desert, cold desert, and arid classifications, including combined variants (e.g., Arid Mountain)
- **Jungle Warfare:** Applies to jungle and rainforest terrain, plus combined forms

**Modifier Application:**
- **Single Specialization:** Divides the environmental penalty by 2 (50% reduction)
- **Dual Specialization:** Stacks multiplicatively. A unit with both Jungle and Mountain Warfare divides the environment modifier by 4 (75% reduction) in combined terrain like Jungle Mountain

## 13.3.2 Field Positions

Forces in ground combat can occupy one of four field positions, each with distinct tactical roles:

### Front Line Attack

- Can target any enemy position (front line, support, rear echelon)
- Rear areas are less likely targets due to weighted-size calculations
- **Forfeits all fortification bonuses** while in attack mode
- Generates doubled morale gains from kills
- Only fully-supplied formations may assume this position

### Front Line Defence

- Can only engage other front-line hostile formations
- Retains fortification bonuses
- Standard morale gains from kills

### Support

- Indirect fire only; cannot directly attack
- Provides bombardment support
- Fires simultaneously with ground support fighters and orbital bombardment
- Same target selection options as heavy bombardment

### Rear Echelon

- Limited fire capability
- Primarily logistical support role
- Less likely to be targeted by enemy front-line attack formations

## 13.3.3 Combat Resolution

### Target Selection

Each front-line formation randomly targets a hostile formation based on weighted formation sizes. Larger formations are more likely to be targeted. Front-line defence can only engage front-line hostiles, while attack formations can target any position.

### To-Hit Calculation

The fundamental accuracy formula:

```
Final To-Hit = (Base 20%) x (Terrain Modifier) x (Morale Ratio) / (Fortification x Environment x Unit Defensive Value)
```

**Modifiers:**
- **Fortification Level:** Divides incoming accuracy (higher = harder to hit)
- **Environmental Penalties:** x2 multiplier per unsuitable condition (gravity, pressure, temperature)
- **Terrain-Trained Units:** 0.5x modifier per matching capability (stacks multiplicatively)
- **Morale:** Ratio between attacker and defender morale affects accuracy
- **Commander GCO Bonus:** Improves accuracy of direct-fire weapons
- **Commander GCA Bonus:** Improves accuracy of indirect-fire weapons

### Damage Resolution

Upon a successful hit, damage is resolved in two stages:

**1. Armor Penetration:**
- Penetration chance = (Weapon AP / Target Armor)^2
- If AP >= Armor, penetration is automatic
- If AP < Armor, penetration becomes increasingly unlikely

**2. Destruction:**
- Destruction probability = (Weapon Damage / Target Hit Points)^2
- If Damage >= HP, destruction is automatic
- If Damage < HP, destruction becomes increasingly unlikely

### Morale Effects

- Successful kills generate morale gains for the attacker (doubled in attack mode)
- Targets suffering kills receive morale losses
- Morale affects to-hit calculations and breakthrough potential
- Maximum morale = 100 + (5 x commander training bonus percentage)
- Morale recovers between combat rounds based on commander training bonus

### Breakthrough Mechanics

When a defending formation takes sufficient damage, breakthrough may occur:

- Breakthrough potential combines defender cohesion damage with attacker breakthrough ratings
- Commander GCM bonus increases breakthrough probability
- When breakthrough potential >= 30%, attacking formations gain **additional attacks**
- Breakthrough attacks do NOT include support capabilities (no artillery, no air support)
- Represents exploitation of a gap in enemy lines

## 13.3.4 Fortification

Fortification represents ground forces digging in and constructing defensive positions. Fortified formations are dramatically harder to dislodge.

### Fortification Levels by Unit Type

| Unit Type | Self-Fortification | Max Fortification | Time to Self-Fortify |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Infantry | 3 | 6 | 30 days |
| Static Weapons | 3 | 6 | 30 days |
| Light/Standard/Heavy Vehicles | 2 | 3 | 30 days |
| Super-Heavy Vehicles | 1.5 | 2 | 30 days |
| Ultra-Heavy Vehicles | 1.25 | 1.5 | 30 days |

### Automatic Self-Fortification

All elements move from non-fortified to their maximum self-fortification level in **30 days** without outside assistance:
- Progression occurs automatically and linearly
- Only occurs when formations are NOT set to front-line attack mode
- Commander GCD bonus increases effective fortification level when fortified

### Construction-Assisted Fortification

Construction elements can fortify other units beyond their self-fortification maximums:

- Only works on elements already at their self-fortification maximum
- Given sufficient capacity, a construction element can fortify any other element from its self-fortification level to maximum fortification in **90 days**
- Construction capacity = construction rating x unit count x racial construction rating x commander bonus x 100 tons
- Multiple construction elements work in parallel

### Fortification in Combat

- Fortification level divides incoming to-hit probability
- Fortification level is further multiplied by the dominant terrain's fortification bonus
- Front-line attack formations forfeit all fortification bonuses
- Moving/loading a formation resets fortification to 0
- Taking casualties does NOT reduce fortification level

### Breaking Fortifications

Approaches to overcoming fortified positions:
- **Overwhelming Force:** Raw combat power to overcome the defensive multiplier
- **Orbital Bombardment:** Reduce fortification levels from orbit before landing
- **Ground Support Fighters:** Aerial bombardment bypasses some fortification benefits
- **Siege:** Sustained combat attrits defenders even through fortifications (costly)
- **Combined Arms:** Heavy armor + artillery most effective against fortified positions

## 13.3.5 Ground Forces Detection

Ground forces use a specialized detection system that rewards defensive positioning.

### Detection Mechanics

- Ground forces are treated as **size-1** for detection purposes
- Resolution-1 sensors are best for detecting them
- Makes ground forces inherently harder to spot than larger space targets

### Signature Calculation

```
Formation Signature = (Total Formation Signature) / 100

Element Signature = (Unit Size x Unit Number) / (Fortification Level x Dominant Terrain Fortification Modifier)
```

### Strategic Implications

- Well-fortified units have smaller signatures than unfortified ones of equivalent strength
- Observers cannot distinguish between "a small force, or a well-fortified larger force" without additional intelligence
- Defensive positioning and fortification reduce detectability
- Reconnaissance is more difficult against prepared positions

## 13.3.6 Ground Support Fighters

Ground support fighters provide aerial assistance during ground combat. They represent a specialized role using fighter pods rather than standard missiles.

### Deployment Requirements

- Fighters must receive a **"Provide Ground Support"** order targeting a friendly population
- Order persists until manually removed (similar to a follow command)
- Only fleets carrying appropriate fighter pods qualify
- Eligible fleets appear in a dedicated section on the Ground Combat Window
- **Protection:** Fleets on ground support duty at their designated population cannot be engaged in standard naval combat or targeted by orbital bombardment weapons

### Combat Integration

- Attack simultaneously with bombardment elements
- Same target selection options as heavy bombardment
- Accuracy influenced by crew quality and unit morale
- Aircraft avoid environmental penalties affecting ground-based units (gravity, temperature)

### Fire Direction Limits

- Each Forward Fire Direction component permits support from up to **6 fighters**
- When fighter assignments exceed FFD capacity, accuracy suffers proportionally:
  ```
  Accuracy Modifier = (Number of FFD x 6) / Number of Fighters
  ```
- Excess fighters beyond FFD capacity still fire but with reduced accuracy

### Fighter Pod Systems

Fighters mount specialized fighter pods rather than traditional missiles:
- Can be swapped between bombardment, autocannon, or air-to-air configurations
- Configuration changes occur while stationed in hangars
- Provide flexible loadout options for different mission types

## 13.3.7 Ground-Based Anti-Aircraft Fire

AA units defend against ground support fighters using specialized targeting mechanics.

### Engagement Rules

- AA units participate in normal ground combat using standard combat values
- Can draw supply **twice** if engaged in both ground-to-ground AND ground-to-air combat simultaneously
- All AA damage applies after all attacks resolve in the combat sequence

### AA Targeting Priority

1. All AA units in a formation directly attacked by aircraft select a random aircraft from those attacking that formation
2. Medium/Heavy AA in parent formations of attacked units target aircraft engaging subordinates
3. Heavy AA units engage random hostile aircraft, including those on combat air patrol

### Accuracy Formula

```
AA To-Hit = (10% x (Tracking Speed / Aircraft Speed) x (Morale / 100)) / Environment Modifier
```

- Units untrained in specific environments face a 2x penalty per environmental condition
- Higher tracking speed relative to aircraft speed improves hit chance
- Commander GCAA bonus improves AA accuracy

### Damage Against Aircraft

```
Aircraft Damage = ((Ground Damage Value / 20)^2) rounded down
```

Example: An AA unit with 40 ground damage inflicts 4 points of damage to fighters (40/20 = 2, 2^2 = 4).

## 13.3.8 Orbital Bombardment Support

Ships equipped with energy weapons can provide precision ground combat assistance when assigned to support friendly formations. This is distinct from general orbital bombardment.

### Deployment

- Ships must receive a **"Provide Orbital Bombardment Support"** order targeting a friendly population
- Ships in orbit appear in the "Orbital Bombardment Support" section of the Ground Combat Window
- Players drag and drop vessels onto ground formations for assignment
- Unlike ground support fighters, these ships **remain vulnerable** to naval combat and surface-to-orbit weapons

### Combat Mechanics

- Ships attack simultaneously with bombardment elements
- Each vessel fires **once per ground combat phase**
- Cannot fire if the ship fired during the preceding naval combat phase in the same increment
- Uses same accuracy system as ground unit bombardment

### Accuracy Modifiers

- Modified by crew grade and morale
- Tactical officer contributes **100%** of their ground support bonus
- Ship commander provides **50%** of their bonus
- Standard ground support accuracy calculations apply

### Damage Conversion (Ship-to-Ground)

Energy weapon damage converts to ground combat values using:

```
Ground Damage = 20 x sqrt(Point Blank Ship-to-Ship Damage)
Armor Penetration = Ground Damage / 2
```

**Examples:**

| Weapon | Ship PB Damage | Ground AP | Ground Damage |
|--------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| 10cm Railgun | ~0.25 | 5 | 10 |
| 10cm Laser | ~3 | 17.3 | 34.6 |
| Heavy Laser | Higher | Higher | Higher |

### Fire Direction Requirements

- Each formation FFD component enables **1 orbital bombardment ship** or **6 ground support fighters**
- If a formation loses FFD capability, ships automatically seek alternative formations at the same location
- Formations without FFD cannot receive orbital bombardment support

### Strategic Considerations

- More accurate than general bombardment (precision directed by ground controllers)
- Ships fire far less frequently than in general bombardment role
- Ships are vulnerable to STO weapons while in support orbit
- Powerful but costly advantage requiring dedicated warships

## 13.3.9 General Orbital Bombardment

General orbital bombardment allows ships in orbit to fire on enemy surface positions to soften defenses, reduce fortification levels, or support friendly forces.

### Bombardment Mechanics

- **Eligible Weapons:** Energy weapons (lasers, particle beams, railguns, etc.)
- **Targeting:** Ships in orbit of a body with enemy ground forces bombard surface formations
- **Damage:** Applied to enemy ground formations, destroying elements and reducing fortification
- **Terrain Modifier:** Terrain to-hit modifier applies to bombardment accuracy (e.g., Jungle Mountain's 0.125 modifier makes bombardment far less effective)

### Bombardment Types

- **Targeted Bombardment:** Focuses fire on military formations, minimizing collateral damage. Less total damage but more precise
- **General Bombardment:** Fires indiscriminately at the surface. Maximum military damage but significant collateral damage to colony infrastructure and population

### Collateral Damage

- **Population Casualties:** General bombardment kills civilians
- **Infrastructure Destruction:** Installations (factories, mines, labs) can be destroyed
- **Political Impact:** Excessive civilian casualties may have diplomatic consequences
- **Capture vs. Destroy:** Excessive bombardment defeats the purpose of capturing a colony

### Reducing Fortification

- Sustained bombardment gradually reduces defending formation fortification levels
- High-damage weapons (particle beams, heavy lasers) are most effective
- Terrain modifier significantly affects bombardment effectiveness against fortified positions
- Monitor progress through the ground forces display

### Anti-Aircraft and STO Defense

- AA elements reduce bombardment effectiveness
- STO weapons can engage bombarding ships, making sustained bombardment costly
- Multiple formations with AA/STO stack their defensive contribution
- Consider suppressing AA/STO assets before committing to prolonged bombardment

## 13.3.10 Boarding Combat

Boarding combat allows ships to attempt capture of enemy vessels through marine assault. This is a specialized form of ground combat that occurs in the confined spaces of a starship.

### Requirements

- Attacking ship must have a **boarding-equipped troop transport bay**
- Only **all-infantry formations** can participate in boarding
- Target ship must **not be faster** than attacking ship
- Fleet must end movement in target's location to trigger the attempt
- Infantry with "Boarding Combat" capability are far more effective

### Boarding Attempt (Transfer Phase)

Individual soldier success chance for reaching the target:

```
Transfer Success = 10% x (Boarding Ship Speed / Target Ship Speed)
```

- Ships 10x faster achieve automatic success (100%)
- Units with **"Boarding Combat" capability** double this probability (only need 5x speed differential for certainty)
- **Failed boarders are killed** -- they represent soldiers lost in the transfer attempt
- If an HQ unit dies and only one exists, the formation commander automatically perishes

### Breaching Phase

After successful transfer, boarders must breach the hull:

- If armor is already breached (from prior combat damage), survivors enter immediately
- Otherwise, boarders apply a **"breaching charge to destroy one armour at the weakest point every thirty seconds"** until access is gained
- Thicker armor means longer breaching time and more vulnerability

### Internal Combat

Once inside the target vessel:

- Combat rounds occur every **60 seconds** (similar to ground combat)
- **No fortification mechanics** beyond a flat **defender bonus of 2**
- Each unit randomly selects opposing targets
- Standard to-hit, armor penetration, and damage calculations apply

### Crew Defense

The target ship's crew forms a temporary defensive formation:

- Crew defense has **armor equal to half the lowest racial armor for infantry**
- Represents improvised defense by non-combat personnel
- Smaller crews are overwhelmed more quickly
- Larger crews provide more targets but also more defenders

### Capture Consequences

Upon defeating all defenders:

- Ship **transfers ownership** to the boarding faction
- Captured ship receives an **overhaul factor of 0.01** (essentially requires complete overhaul)
- Simulates sabotage, locked controls, and unfamiliar systems
- Ship must be returned to a shipyard for overhaul before being fully operational

### Collateral Damage

Internal combat causes ship damage:

- Fractional damage results apply as **percentage chances** of full-point damage conversion
- Critical systems may be damaged during the fighting
- The captured ship may require significant repairs beyond the overhaul

### Practical Tips

- Boarding is most effective against slower or disabled ships
- Fast boarding ships with large infantry capacity maximize transfer success
- The "Boarding Combat" capability is essential for infantry intended for boarding operations
- Consider the cost-benefit: a heavily damaged captured ship may not be worth the marine casualties
- Elite boarding infantry with genetic enhancements make the best marines due to their increased hit points

## 13.3.11 Combat Summary

### Ground Combat Flow (per 8-hour phase)

1. **Supply Check:** Verify formation supply status; unsupplied units restricted to 25% fire rate
2. **Target Selection:** Front-line formations randomly select targets weighted by formation size
3. **Bombardment Phase:** Support elements, ground support fighters, and orbital bombardment ships fire
4. **Direct Combat Phase:** Front-line elements engage selected targets
5. **AA Phase:** Anti-aircraft elements engage attacking aircraft (damage applied after all attacks)
6. **Casualty Assessment:** Hits resolved through AP check then damage check; destroyed elements removed
7. **Morale Update:** Kills generate morale gains/losses; morale recovery calculated
8. **Breakthrough Check:** If breakthrough potential >= 30%, additional attacks without support
9. **Fortification Update:** Self-fortification progresses (if not in attack mode); construction elements work
