# 13.3 Ground Combat

Ground combat in Aurora C# resolves battles between opposing formations on the same planetary body. Unlike naval combat, which plays out in real-time with individual weapon shots, ground combat is resolved in phases during each time increment, with formations attacking and defending based on their combat strength, fortification level, and supporting elements.

## 13.3.1 Combat Resolution

Ground combat occurs automatically when hostile formations are present on the same body. The combat resolution system evaluates opposing forces and determines casualties each increment.

**Combat Phases**

Each ground combat cycle proceeds through these phases:

1. **Bombardment Phase:** Artillery elements from both sides fire first. Bombardment damage is applied to enemy formations based on the total bombardment value of your artillery elements versus the enemy's defensive value
2. **Direct Combat Phase:** All combat elements engage in direct combat. Each formation's total combat strength is compared to the enemy's defensive strength
3. **Casualty Assessment:** Damage from both phases is converted into element losses. Destroyed elements are permanently removed from the formation
4. **Morale Check:** Formations that have taken heavy casualties may break and cease fighting effectively, or in extreme cases be destroyed entirely

**Combat Strength Calculation**

A formation's effective combat strength is determined by several factors:

- **Base Strength:** The sum of all combat element values in the formation
- **Commander Bonus:** If a skilled ground force commander is assigned, their bonus multiplies the formation's strength
- **HQ Bonus:** The presence of headquarters elements provides a command multiplier
- **Fortification Bonus:** Defending formations that have fortified receive a significant defensive multiplier (see Section 13.3.2)
- **Technology Level:** Higher ground combat technology provides inherent bonuses to element combat values
- **Morale:** Formations with high morale fight more effectively; morale degrades as casualties mount

**Attacker vs. Defender**

The game designates formations as attackers or defenders based on which side's forces arrived on the body most recently:

- Forces already present on a body when combat begins are defenders
- Forces that land on or drop onto an occupied enemy body are attackers
- Defenders benefit from fortification bonuses; attackers do not
- The attacker/defender distinction is significant because fortification provides substantial defensive multipliers

**Combat Example**

Consider an assault on a defended colony:

- **Defender:** 2 infantry formations (fortified to level 3), 1 artillery formation, garrison HQ
- **Attacker:** 3 mechanized infantry formations, 1 heavy armor formation, 1 artillery formation

The attacker has superior raw combat strength from the armor, but the defender's fortification bonus significantly increases their effective defense. The battle may take several combat cycles to resolve, with the attacker grinding down the fortifications while taking significant casualties from the defender's artillery.

**Winning Ground Combat**

A ground battle is won when all enemy formations on the body are either destroyed or have been eliminated through attrition. There is no retreat mechanic for ground forces; formations fight until destroyed or the enemy is eliminated. The only way to withdraw ground forces is to load them onto transports and leave orbit.

**Practical Tips:**

- Raw numbers matter; even elite formations can be overwhelmed by sufficient quantity of cheaper units
- Always include HQ elements in your combat formations; the command bonus is a direct multiplier to combat effectiveness
- Artillery formations are worth their transport cost; the bombardment phase gives you "free" damage before the main combat resolves
- Scout the enemy with recon elements before committing; landing an infantry brigade against a fortified armored division is a waste of lives
- Ground combat can be a war of attrition; plan for sustained campaigns by having reinforcement formations ready to deploy

## 13.3.2 Fortification

Fortification represents ground forces digging in, constructing defensive positions, and preparing the terrain for defense. Fortified formations are dramatically harder to dislodge than unfortified ones, making fortification a critical factor in ground combat planning.

**Fortification Levels**

Fortification is measured in levels, starting at 0 (no fortification) and increasing over time:

- **Level 0:** No fortification bonus; the formation fights at base strength
- **Level 1:** Basic defensive positions providing a moderate defensive multiplier
- **Level 2:** Improved fortifications with stronger multiplier
- **Level 3:** Strong fortifications; attacking these positions requires significant force superiority
- **Level 4:** Heavy fortifications; extremely difficult to assault
- **Level 5 (Maximum):** Maximum fortification; only overwhelming force or sustained orbital bombardment can break these positions

Each fortification level provides an increasing multiplicative bonus to the formation's defensive combat strength. The bonus is cumulative, meaning a formation at level 5 is many times harder to defeat than an unfortified one.

**Building Fortification**

Formations build fortification passively over time when given the order to fortify:

- **Base Rate:** All formations can fortify at a base rate determined by their size and composition
- **Engineer Bonus:** Formations containing engineer elements fortify significantly faster
- **Time:** Moving from level 0 to level 1 takes relatively little time, but each subsequent level takes progressively longer
- **Movement Resets Fortification:** If a formation is loaded onto transports and moved, its fortification level resets to 0 at the new location
- **Combat Does Not Reset:** Taking casualties during combat does not reduce fortification level; the position remains fortified even as the garrison is depleted

**Fortification and Offense**

Fortification only benefits defenders. An attacking formation (one that has just landed on a body) receives no fortification bonus regardless of how long it has been on the surface, until the combat is resolved and the territory is secured. Once all enemy forces are eliminated, the formerly attacking formation can then begin fortifying its new position.

**Breaking Fortifications**

Heavily fortified positions can be addressed through several approaches:

- **Overwhelming Force:** Bring sufficient combat power to overcome the defensive multiplier through raw strength
- **Orbital Bombardment:** Reduce fortification levels from orbit before landing ground forces (see Section 13.3.3)
- **Siege:** Sustained ground combat gradually attrits the defender even through fortifications, but this is costly
- **Combined Arms:** Heavy armor and artillery combinations are most effective against fortified positions

**Practical Tips:**

- Always order your garrison formations to fortify immediately upon landing; even level 1 provides meaningful defense
- Fortification is the great equalizer; a small, cheap garrison formation at level 5 can hold against a much larger attacking force
- When planning an invasion, factor in the time the defender has had to fortify; a colony garrisoned for years will be at maximum fortification
- Engineers are essential for rapid fortification; include them in any formation you expect to use defensively
- Consider the cost-benefit of orbital bombardment vs. ground assault casualties when attacking fortified positions
- Pre-positioning garrison forces on potential target worlds well before conflict begins gives them time to reach maximum fortification

## 13.3.3 Orbital Bombardment

Orbital bombardment allows ships in orbit to support ground operations by firing on enemy surface positions. This can soften enemy defenses before a landing, reduce fortification levels, or support friendly ground forces already engaged in combat.

**Bombardment Mechanics**

Ships conduct orbital bombardment using their weapons against ground targets:

- **Eligible Weapons:** Energy weapons (lasers, particle beams, etc.) can be used for orbital bombardment. Missiles are not used for bombardment in the standard rules
- **Targeting:** Ships in orbit of a body with enemy ground forces can be ordered to bombard. The bombardment hits formations on the surface
- **Damage:** Bombardment damage is applied to enemy ground formations, destroying elements and potentially reducing fortification levels
- **Collateral Damage:** Orbital bombardment can cause collateral damage to the colony's infrastructure and population. Indiscriminate bombardment may destroy installations and kill civilians

**Bombardment Orders**

To conduct orbital bombardment:

1. Move a task group with beam-armed ships into orbit of the target body
2. Issue the bombardment order from the task group orders menu
3. Select the bombardment type (targeted or general)
4. The ships will begin bombarding during each time increment they remain in orbit with the order active

**Bombardment Types**

- **Targeted Bombardment:** Attempts to focus fire on military formations, minimizing collateral damage to infrastructure and population. Less total damage but more precise
- **General Bombardment:** Fires indiscriminately at the surface, causing maximum damage to ground forces but also significant collateral damage to the colony. More effective militarily but politically and economically costly

**Reducing Fortification**

One of the primary uses of orbital bombardment is to reduce enemy fortification levels before landing ground forces:

- Sustained bombardment will gradually reduce the fortification level of defending formations
- Reducing fortification from level 5 to level 0 requires significant bombardment over multiple increments
- Ships with high-damage weapons (particle beams, heavy lasers) are most effective for this purpose
- Monitor bombardment progress through the ground forces display

**Anti-Aircraft Defense**

Defending formations with anti-aircraft elements can reduce bombardment effectiveness:

- AA elements provide a percentage reduction in incoming bombardment damage
- Multiple formations with AA elements stack their defensive contribution
- Sufficiently strong AA defense can make bombardment inefficient, forcing a direct ground assault
- Consider targeting AA-heavy formations first if conducting targeted bombardment

**Collateral Damage Considerations**

Orbital bombardment is a powerful tool but carries significant costs:

- **Population Casualties:** General bombardment kills civilians, reducing the colony's population
- **Infrastructure Destruction:** Installations (factories, mines, research labs) can be destroyed
- **Political Impact:** Causing excessive civilian casualties may have diplomatic consequences with other races
- **Capture vs. Destroy:** If your goal is to capture a functioning colony, excessive bombardment defeats the purpose

**Practical Tips:**

- Use targeted bombardment when you want to capture the colony intact; use general bombardment only when you want to eliminate the enemy regardless of collateral damage
- A few days of orbital bombardment before landing can dramatically reduce your ground assault casualties by stripping away fortification levels
- Particle beam ships are particularly effective bombardment platforms due to their high per-shot damage
- Do not bombard if your own forces are on the surface; you will hit them too
- Consider the trade-off: a heavily bombarded colony may not be worth capturing if all its infrastructure is destroyed
- Keep bombardment ships protected by escort vessels; the enemy may send a relief fleet while your ships are occupied with surface operations
- If the enemy has strong AA elements, you may need to accept a ground assault without bombardment support, or commit to a prolonged bombardment campaign to suppress the AA first
