# 13.2 Training, Logistics, and Transport

*Updated: v2026.01.30*

![13.2 Training, Logistics, and Transport](../images/art/section-art/13.2.png)

Ground forces must be constructed at colonies with appropriate facilities, supplied through logistics systems during combat, and transported to their destination via dedicated troop transport ships. This section covers construction, supply mechanics, and deployment.

## 13.2.1 Ground Force Construction Complex

*Updated: v2026.01.30*

![13.2 Training, Logistics, and Transport](../images/art/section-art/13.2.png)

Ground unit construction in Aurora C# is handled through the **Ground Force Construction Complex** (renamed from the VB6 "Training Facility"). This planetary installation produces ground formations from queued formation templates.

### 13.2.1.1 Facility Requirements

- **Physical Size:** Same footprint as a research facility (500,000 cargo points each) \hyperlink{ref-13.2-1}{[1]}
- **Mineral Cost (v2.7.0):** 2,400 Vendarite (changed from 1,200 Duranium / 1,200 Neutronium) \hyperlink{ref-13.2-2}{[2]}
- **Workforce:** Requires 1,000,000 (one million) population to operate -- a substantial increase from VB6's zero-worker requirement \hyperlink{ref-13.2-3}{[3]}
- **Base Build Rate:** 250 Build Points per year \hyperlink{ref-13.2-4}{[4]}
- **Research Upgrades:** Build rate can be increased through dedicated research: \hyperlink{ref-13.2-4}{[4]}
  - 500 BP/year: costs 8,000 Research Points
  - 1,000 BP/year: costs 60,000 Research Points

### 13.2.1.2 Construction Process

1. **Design Formation Template:** Create a blueprint specifying unit classes and quantities (see [Section 13.1 Unit Types](13.1-unit-types.md))
2. **Queue for Production:** Add templates to the construction queue at a colony with a Ground Force Construction Complex
3. **Build Point Accumulation:** Facilities generate BP per year, consuming minerals from the colony stockpile
4. **Completion:** When accumulated BP equals the formation's total cost, the formation becomes available
5. **Queue Continuation:** When a training task completes without using all production, work begins on the next item in the queue automatically

### 13.2.1.3 Queued Training Tasks

When no Ground Force Construction Complex (GFCC) is available, formations can be placed in a training queue:

- **Queue Management:** Items can be moved up and down the queue, deleted, and renamed while in the queue
- **Auto-Start:** When a GFCC becomes available, the highest-priority queued formation begins training immediately and generates an event notification
- **Flexible Costs:** The build cost is not fixed until training begins -- players can change templates for formations still in the queue without cost penalties
- **Multiple Queuing:** Multiple formations can wait in the queue simultaneously, providing strategic planning flexibility before resources are committed

### 13.2.1.4 Build Time Calculation

Time to complete = (Formation total BP cost) / (Number of facilities x BP per facility per year)

- Simple infantry formations can be completed quickly even with few facilities
- Heavy armor formations with many high-cost elements take significantly longer
- Multiple facilities on the same colony work in parallel on the same formation
- Ground unit cost is rounded to 3 decimal places for precision
- As of v2.4.0, the game prevents total ground construction task percentages from exceeding 100%, ensuring resource allocation across multiple simultaneous tasks remains valid

### 13.2.1.5 Text Summaries

Two text summary features assist in formation planning and record-keeping:

- **Template as Text ('Temp as Text' button):** Generates a text version of the selected template composition, including formation name, transport size in tonnage, build cost in BP, and an itemized listing of all unit types and quantities
- **Total Force Text ('Total Force Text' button on Order of Battle tab):** Displays the entire ground force structure including total formation count, total transport size, total cost, and a comprehensive unit inventory across all formations
- Both summaries can be copied using Ctrl+C for pasting into after-action reports (AARs)

### 13.2.1.6 Population List Sorting (v2.6.0)

*Added: v2.6.0*

The Ground Forces window displays populations **sorted alphabetically by name** rather than by creation date. This makes it significantly easier to locate specific populations when managing ground forces across many colonies, particularly in large empires with dozens of settled worlds.

### 13.2.1.7 Automated Ground Force Replacements (v2.7.0)

The Economics window GU Training tab includes a "Build Replacements" checkbox that automates replacement of damaged formations:

- Ground force construction complexes automatically build replacement units for formations with assigned templates that have sustained losses
- Formations are processed in replacement priority order
- Remaining construction capacity carries forward between construction phases
- This eliminates the need to manually queue replacement units after combat losses

### 13.2.1.8 Ground Support Fighters Removed (v2.8.0)

As of v2.8.0, all fighter-based ground support orders have been eliminated:

- Fighter flak suppression and search-and-destroy orders are removed
- Fighter pods are removed from research and missile design
- Orbital bombardment by larger ships remains unaffected
- Ground unit close air support options are planned for a future update

### 13.2.1.9 Practical Tips

- Build Ground Force Construction Complexes early; ground forces take time to produce
- The million-population requirement means only developed colonies can produce ground forces
- Research build rate improvements if you need to produce forces quickly
- Design several formation templates of different sizes for different purposes
- Enable "Build Replacements" to automatically replenish combat losses

## 13.2.2 Commander Assignment

*Updated: v2026.01.30*

![13.2 Training, Logistics, and Transport](../images/art/section-art/13.2.png)

Each formation can be assigned a ground force commander who provides multiple combat and operational bonuses.

### 13.2.2.1 Commander Bonus Types

| Bonus | Abbreviation | Effect |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Ground Combat Defence | GCD | Increases fortification level of elements when fortified |
| Ground Combat Offence | GCO | Improves accuracy of direct-fire weapons |
| Ground Combat Artillery | GCA | Enhances accuracy of indirect-fire (bombardment) weapons |
| Ground Combat Anti-Aircraft | GCAA | Boosts anti-aircraft weapon effectiveness |
| Ground Combat Logistics | GCL | Reduces supply consumption of combat units during combat rounds |
| Ground Combat Manoeuvre | GCM | Increases probability of breakthrough attacks succeeding |
| Ground Combat Occupation | OCC | Strengthens control of conquered territory |
| Ground Combat Training | GCT | Accelerates morale recovery (see below) |
| Survey | SRV | Enhances ground-based survey module output |
| Xenoarchaeology | XEN | Enhances xenoarchaeology module output |
| Decontamination | DEC | Rare bonus for radiation reduction operations |

\hyperlink{ref-13.2-5}{[5]}

### 13.2.2.2 Ground Support Bonus

The Ground Support Bonus affects naval officers commanding ships and fighters on ground support missions:

- **Applicable Missions:** Ground support, search and destroy, flak suppression, and orbital bombardment support
- **Orbital Bombardment Calculation:** The Tactical Officer contributes 100% of their bonus; the Ship Commander contributes 50% of their bonus *(unverified — [#837](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/837) -- bonus calculation requires live testing)*
- **Impact:** Modifies the to-hit chance for affected weapons systems, allowing well-trained officers to significantly improve accuracy of close air support and orbital bombardment operations

### 13.2.2.3 Command Capacity

Commanders have a **Ground Combat Command** rating that determines the maximum formation size they can effectively lead:

- If commanding forces exceeding this rating, bonus effectiveness reduces proportionally
- Headquarters unit capacity similarly penalizes oversized formations
- Match commander capacity to formation size for full bonus effectiveness

### 13.2.2.4 Morale and Training

Officers with Ground Combat Training bonus accelerate morale recovery:

- Formation elements can exceed the standard 100-morale maximum
- Maximum achievable morale = 100 + (5 x training bonus percentage) *(unverified — [#837](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/837) -- morale formula requires live testing)*
- Recovery rates are calculated through formulas accounting for current morale levels
- Higher morale directly improves combat effectiveness

## 13.2.3 Ground Force Replacements

*Updated: v2026.01.30*

![13.2 Training, Logistics, and Transport](../images/art/section-art/13.2.png)

An automated replacement system reduces the micromanagement burden of reorganizing ground forces after combat. The system handles reinforcement of damaged formations through several interconnected components.

### 13.2.3.1 Replacement Templates

Each formation can be assigned a **Replacement Template** -- typically the template used during initial construction:

- Players can modify template assignments through the Order of Battle tab
- Template changes can be applied across multiple formations simultaneously
- Replacement templates may differ from construction templates, allowing players to add new capabilities or discontinue obsolete unit types during reinforcement

#### 13.2.3.1.1 Template Obsolescence (v2.6.0)

*Added: v2.6.0*

Ground force templates are now **obsoleted** rather than deleted when replaced or discontinued:

- Obsolete templates remain viewable in the interface for historical reference
- This preserves the formation design history and prevents accidental data loss
- Obsolete templates can be distinguished from active templates in the template list
- Players can review previously-used formation designs when planning upgrades or analyzing past campaigns

#### 13.2.3.1.2 Batch Template Assignment

The Ground Forces window provides a **'Set all formations with same template'** batch operation. When you select a formation and apply a new template using this option, the game automatically updates all other formations that share the same existing template to the new template. This saves significant time when upgrading or reorganizing multiple formations simultaneously -- for example, updating all "Rifle Infantry Platoon" formations to a revised "Rifle Infantry Platoon Mk2" template in a single action rather than changing each formation individually.

#### 13.2.3.1.3 Copy + Upgrade Numbering (v2.7.0)

*Added: v2.7.0*

When using **Copy + Upgrade** on a ground force template, the formation numbering from the original template is preserved. This maintains organizational continuity when upgrading formations to newer designs -- the 1st Armored Regiment remains the 1st Armored Regiment even after being upgraded to a new template configuration.

### 13.2.3.2 Replacement Priority

Formations receive a replacement priority value (default: 10) that determines reinforcement order \hyperlink{ref-13.2-9}{[9]}:

- When replacements are available, they are assigned to formations in **descending order of priority**
- Higher priority values receive replacements first
- This ensures critical front-line formations are reinforced before rear-echelon units

### 13.2.3.3 Replacement Formations

Designated replacement formations serve as the supply pool for reinforcements:

- During each construction phase and after ground combat, units are moved from designated replacement formations to any formations at the same population that need replacements
- Replacement formations must be at the same population as the formations requiring reinforcement
- The system automatically matches unit types from the replacement pool to formation vacancies

### 13.2.3.4 Unit Series Integration

The replacement system uses Unit Series (see [Section 13.1 Unit Types](13.1-unit-types.md)) rather than exact unit class matches:

- When replacements occur, the system uses the Unit Series of each unit in the Replacement Template rather than the specific unit class
- This enables automatic substitution with upgraded versions without requiring template updates
- For example, if a newer infantry design is in the same Unit Series as the template's original design, the newer version is provided as the replacement

## 13.2.4 Ground Force Logistics

*Updated: v2026.01.30*

![13.2 Training, Logistics, and Transport](../images/art/section-art/13.2.png)

Ground units require two distinct resource types for sustained operations: maintenance (ongoing wealth cost) and Ground Supply Points (combat consumables).

### 13.2.4.1 Maintenance

All ground units require ongoing maintenance:

- **Cost:** 12.5% of Ground Unit build cost per annum as a wealth expense *(unverified — [#837](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/837) -- maintenance percentage requires live testing)*
- **Applies to:** All units regardless of combat status
- **Effect of shortfall:** Units lacking maintenance suffer degraded effectiveness

### 13.2.4.2 Ground Supply Points (GSP)

Combat units consume GSP during ground combat only. GSP represents ammunition and combat consumables.

**GSP Calculation per Component:** \hyperlink{ref-13.2-6}{[6]}
```
GSP per 10 combat rounds = Penetration Value x Damage Value x Shots
```

**Example:** A tank with:

- Medium Anti-Vehicle component: 4 x 4 x 1 = 16 GSP \hyperlink{ref-13.2-6}{[6]}
- Crew Served Anti-Personnel component: 1 x 1 x 6 = 6 GSP
- **Total:** 22 GSP per 10 combat rounds

### 13.2.4.3 Inherent Supply

Each ground unit carries inherent supply sufficient for **10 combat rounds** \hyperlink{ref-13.2-10}{[10]}. After exhausting inherent supply:

- Units fire at only **25% effectiveness** *(unverified — [#837](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/837) -- effectiveness penalty requires live testing)*
- Units **cannot** occupy "Front Line Attack" positions *(unverified — [#837](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/837) -- position restriction requires live testing)*
- Must draw from logistics elements to continue at full effectiveness

### 13.2.4.4 Logistics Supply Hierarchy

Units prioritize drawing supplies in a specific order:

1. Check own formation's logistics elements first
2. Check parent formation logistics
3. Continue checking up the hierarchy at each stage
4. Vehicle-based logistics can supply **other formations**
5. Infantry-based logistics can only supply **their own formation**

### 13.2.4.5 Supply Consumption Mechanics

When formation elements draw supplies:

- Logistics vehicles are **consumed** based on GSP requirements (they represent expendable supply trucks/carriers)
- Partial consumption uses **probabilistic allocation** to introduce realistic uncertainty
- A formation may draw supplies unevenly across combat rounds

> **Important Distinction -- GCL vs. Logistics Units:** The Ground Combat Logistics (GCL) commander bonus applies to **combat units**, reducing how much supply they consume per combat round. It does NOT apply to logistics/support units themselves. Logistics units provide the supply pool; GCL training makes combat units more efficient at consuming that supply. A commander with high GCL effectively stretches the formation's logistics vehicles further by reducing per-round consumption of the combat elements.

### 13.2.4.6 Logistics Planning

| Module Type | Size | GSP Capacity | Platform | Cross-Formation |
|------------|------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| Standard Logistics Module | 50 tons | 1,000 GSP | Light vehicle+ | Yes |
| Small Logistics Module | 10 tons | 100 GSP | Infantry only | No |

\hyperlink{ref-13.2-7}{[7]}

**Planning Formula:**
To determine logistics requirements, calculate total GSP consumption per 10 rounds for all combat elements, then divide by module GSP capacity to determine how many logistics elements are needed for the desired number of combat rounds.

## 13.2.5 Transport Requirements

*Updated: v2026.01.30*

![13.2 Training, Logistics, and Transport](../images/art/section-art/13.2.png)

Moving ground formations between bodies requires dedicated troop transport capacity. Standard cargo holds cannot carry ground units; you must design ships with troop transport bays.

### 13.2.5.1 Troop Transport Bay

The Troop Transport Bay is a ship component that provides capacity for carrying ground force elements:

- **Capacity:** Each bay holds a fixed tonnage of ground unit elements \hyperlink{ref-13.2-8}{[8]}
- **Research:** Basic troop transport capability is available from game start; improved bays require research
- **Size:** Transport bays are large components that consume significant hull space \hyperlink{ref-13.2-8}{[8]}
- **No Cargo Dual-Use:** Troop transport capacity is separate from cargo capacity

**Troop Transport Bay Sizes:** \hyperlink{ref-13.2-8}{[8]}

| Bay Size | Ship Size (HS) | Capacity (tons) | Cost (BP) |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Very Small | 2 | 100 | 3 |
| Small | 5 | 250 | 6 |
| Standard | 20 | 1,000 | 20 |
| Conventional | 40 | 1,000 | 20 |
| Large | 100 | 5,000 | 80 |
| Very Large | 500 | 25,000 | 320 |

### 13.2.5.2 Calculating Transport Requirements

To determine transport needs:

1. **Check Formation Tonnage:** Each formation template shows total transport tonnage
2. **Sum All Formations:** Add tonnages for all formations to be moved
3. **Compare to Fleet Capacity:** Transport fleet's total bay capacity must equal or exceed combined tonnage
4. **Plan for Attrition:** Build extra capacity to allow for losses in transit

### 13.2.5.3 Loading and Unloading

Ground formations are loaded and unloaded through task group orders:

- **Load Formation:** Issue to a task group in orbit of a body with ground formations. Loads until bays are full
- **Unload Formation:** Issue at destination to deploy formations to the surface
- **Specific Formations:** You can specify which formations to load
- **Loading Time:** Base load/unload time is **10 days** for brigade-sized modules. *(unverified — [#837](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/837) -- loading time requires live testing)* This is reduced by Cargo Handling Systems on the transport vessel and by spaceport infrastructure at the colony. Smaller formations load proportionally faster. Plan troop movements with this loading time in mind, particularly during time-critical deployments.

#### 13.2.5.3.1 Colony Marker Requirement

Ground forces can only be loaded onto or unloaded from ships at locations with a **colony marker** present on the body. This applies even if the colony has zero population or no infrastructure -- the colony marker itself is the requirement. You cannot load or unload troops at arbitrary points in space or at bodies without an established colony. If you need to deploy forces to an unclaimed body, you must first establish a colony (even a token one) before troop transport operations become available.

#### 13.2.5.3.2 Formation Splitting Constraint

A single formation **cannot be split across multiple transport ships**. The entire formation must fit within the troop transport capacity of a single vessel. If a formation's total tonnage exceeds the available transport bay capacity on any one ship, it cannot be loaded. To work around this limitation:

- **Design larger transports:** Build ships with enough bay capacity to carry your largest formations
- **Split formations before loading:** Break large formations into smaller sub-formations that each fit on a single transport
- **Plan template sizes around transport capacity:** When designing formation templates, consider the transport bay capacity of your fleet to ensure formations remain loadable

### 13.2.5.4 Boarding Transport

For boarding operations, ships require a specialized **boarding-equipped troop transport bay**:

- Only all-infantry formations can be loaded for boarding operations
- Infantry must have the "Boarding Combat" capability to participate effectively
- Target ship must not be faster than attacking ship
- Fleet must end movement in target's location to trigger attempt

### 13.2.5.5 Transport Ship Design Considerations (see [Section 8.1 Design Philosophy](../8-ship-design/8.1-design-philosophy.md))

- **Speed:** Must keep up with escort fleet or transit independently in secure space
- **Armor/Shields:** Some protection is advisable for high-value targets, but excessive armor reduces capacity
- **Self-Defense:** Minimal point defense may be worthwhile
- **Fuel Range:** Sufficient for planned deployment distance
- **Maintenance:** Adequate maintenance supply storage for long deployments

## 13.2.6 Drop Operations

*Updated: v2026.01.30*

![13.2 Training, Logistics, and Transport](../images/art/section-art/13.2.png)

Drop operations deploy ground forces from orbit directly to a planetary surface under combat conditions, bypassing the need for a secured landing zone.

### 13.2.6.1 Combat Drop Capability

- **Drop-Capable Formations:** Only formations designed with drop-capable elements can conduct orbital assault
- **Drop Module:** Specialized transport ship component enabling deployment under fire
- **Risk:** Combat drops carry inherent casualties during descent regardless of enemy action
- **Speed:** Drops execute quickly for rapid force deployment

### 13.2.6.2 Orbital Assault Sequence

1. **Achieve Orbital Superiority:** Fleet must control orbital space; enemy ships will engage transports
2. **Suppress Defenses:** Consider orbital bombardment to reduce AA elements and STO weapons first
3. **Execute Drop:** Issue combat drop order; drop-capable formations deploy to surface
4. **Reinforce:** Once beachhead established, conventional formations can unload normally
5. **Consolidate:** Landed forces should immediately begin fortifying

### 13.2.6.3 Drop Module Morale

Troops loaded into standard (non-cryogenic) drop modules **lose morale over time** while waiting in the modules. This represents the psychological stress of being confined in drop pods awaiting combat deployment:

- **Morale Decay Rate:** Troops in non-cryogenic drop modules lose **1 morale point per day** while loaded. *(unverified — [#837](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/837) -- morale decay rate requires live testing)* A formation starting at 100 morale would drop to 80 morale after 20 days in standard drop modules.
- **Combat Effectiveness Threshold:** Since combat effectiveness scales linearly with morale (Strength x Morale/100), troops at 50 morale fight at only 50% effectiveness. Morale cannot drop below 25 under normal circumstances *(unverified — [#837](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/837) -- morale floor requires live testing)* (see [Section 16.2 Skills and Bonuses](../16-commanders/16.2-skills-and-bonuses.md)).
- **Cryogenic Combat Drop Modules:** A research-unlockable variant that places troops in suspended animation, completely eliminating morale loss during transit. Troops emerge at the same morale level they had when loaded. Cryogenic modules are larger than standard drop modules but essential for long-distance assault operations.
- **Morale Recovery:** Once unloaded from drop modules, formation elements recover morale at a base rate of 100 points per year, plus the commander's training bonus *(unverified — [#837](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/837) -- recovery rate requires live testing)* (e.g., a 20% training bonus increases recovery to 120 points per year). See [Section 13.2.2 Commander Assignment](#1322-commander-assignment) for training bonus details.
- **Tactical Advice:** Transfer troops to drop pods only immediately before the planned assault. Loading troops into drop modules days or weeks before the attack degrades their combat effectiveness through morale loss, potentially resulting in a force that arrives at the target demoralized and less effective.

> **Warning:** A common mistake is loading assault troops into drop modules at the staging colony and transiting for extended periods before attacking. By the time the drop executes, troop morale may be significantly degraded. Either research Cryogenic Combat Drop Modules or plan logistics so that troops are loaded into drop pods only at the final staging point, immediately before the assault.

> **Tip:** Include Cargo Handling Systems on your drop transports. Troops begin losing morale as soon as the transfer to drop modules begins, so faster loading times minimize morale loss during the loading process itself.

### 13.2.6.4 Drop Casualties

- A percentage of elements may be destroyed during the drop itself
- Enemy anti-aircraft elements on the surface increase drop casualties significantly
- Larger, heavier elements suffer proportionally more drop casualties than infantry
- Research in ground combat technology can reduce base drop casualty rates

### 13.2.6.5 When to Use Drops vs. Conventional Landing

| Situation | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Undefended or lightly defended body | Conventional landing |
| Heavily defended, you have orbital superiority | Bombardment then conventional landing |
| Strong ground forces, need surprise | Combat drop for beachhead |
| Time-critical objective | Combat drop for speed |
| Friendly forces already on surface | Conventional reinforcement |

### 13.2.6.6 Practical Tips

- Do not use combat drops when conventional landing is possible; casualties are wasteful
- Infantry formations make the best drop troops due to low weight and acceptable casualty rates
- Heavy armor is poor for drop operations; high transport cost and high drop casualties
- Always achieve orbital superiority before attempting a drop
- Consider landing recon elements first to assess the situation
