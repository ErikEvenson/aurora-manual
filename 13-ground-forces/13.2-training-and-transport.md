# 13.2 Training and Transport

Ground forces must be constructed at colonies with appropriate facilities, then transported to their destination via dedicated troop transport ships. This section covers the full lifecycle from building formations to delivering them to the battlefield.

## 13.2.1 Training Facilities

Ground unit construction in Aurora C# is handled through the Ground Forces Training window, which allows you to design formation templates and queue them for production.

**Ground Force Training Facilities**

Ground force training facilities are the planetary installations responsible for producing ground units. Each facility contributes a set amount of build capacity per year toward completing formation construction:

- **Build Rate:** Each training facility produces a fixed number of build points per year
- **Mineral Consumption:** Facilities consume minerals from the colony stockpile as formations are built
- **Parallel Construction:** Multiple facilities on the same colony can work on the same or different formations simultaneously
- **Research Requirement:** Advanced element types require prerequisite ground combat technologies

**Formation Design**

Before building ground units, you must design formation templates. Formation design is accessed through the Ground Forces window:

1. **Name the Formation Template:** Give your formation a descriptive name (e.g., "Mechanized Infantry Brigade" or "Heavy Armor Division")
2. **Add Elements:** Select element types and specify the quantity of each element in the formation
3. **Review Tonnage:** The total transport tonnage is calculated from all elements, which determines how much troop transport capacity is needed to move the formation
4. **Review Build Cost:** The total mineral cost and build points required are displayed, showing how long construction will take given your available training facilities
5. **Save the Template:** Once designed, the template can be used to queue multiple formations of the same type

**Build Points and Time**

The time to build a formation depends on the total build points required (sum of all elements) divided by the total build capacity of your training facilities:

- Simple infantry formations can be completed quickly even with few facilities
- Heavy armor formations with many high-cost elements take significantly longer
- You can increase production speed by building additional training facilities
- The Ground Forces tab shows the current build queue and estimated completion times

**Commander Assignment**

Each formation can be assigned a ground force commander. Commanders provide bonuses based on their skills:

- **Ground Combat Bonus:** Directly improves formation combat effectiveness
- **Logistics Bonus:** Can improve formation supply efficiency
- Commanders gain experience from combat, improving their bonuses over time
- Unassigned formations fight at base effectiveness without commander bonuses

**Practical Tips:**

- Build training facilities early; ground forces take time to produce and you do not want to be caught without a garrison
- Design several formation templates of different sizes: small garrison units for minor colonies, and larger assault formations for offensive operations
- Keep formation templates reasonable in size; a formation with 1,000 elements will take a very long time to build and require enormous transport capacity
- Experienced commanders are invaluable; assign your best officers to formations that will see combat

## 13.2.2 Transport Requirements

Moving ground formations between bodies requires dedicated troop transport capacity. Standard cargo holds cannot carry ground units; you must design ships with troop transport bays.

**Troop Transport Bay**

The Troop Transport Bay is a ship component that provides capacity for carrying ground force elements:

- **Capacity:** Each bay holds a fixed tonnage of ground unit elements
- **Research:** Basic troop transport capability is available from game start; improved bays require research
- **Size:** Transport bays are large components that consume significant hull space
- **No Cargo Dual-Use:** Troop transport capacity is separate from cargo capacity; a ship cannot use cargo holds to move troops

**Calculating Transport Requirements**

To determine how many transports you need for a given operation:

1. **Check Formation Tonnage:** Each formation shows its total transport tonnage in the Ground Forces window
2. **Sum All Formations:** If moving multiple formations, add their tonnages together
3. **Compare to Fleet Capacity:** Your transport fleet's total troop bay capacity must equal or exceed the combined tonnage
4. **Plan for Attrition:** Consider building extra transport capacity to allow for losses in transit

**Loading and Unloading**

Ground formations are loaded and unloaded through task group orders:

- **Load Formation:** Issue this order to a task group in orbit of a body with ground formations present. The task group will load formations until its transport bays are full
- **Unload Formation:** Issue this order at the destination to deploy formations to the surface
- **Specific Formations:** You can specify which formations to load rather than loading all available
- **Loading Time:** Loading and unloading is essentially instantaneous in game terms

**Transport Ship Design Considerations**

When designing troop transports, consider the following:

- **Speed:** Transports should be fast enough to keep up with their escort fleet, or fast enough to transit independently if operating in secure space
- **Armor/Shields:** Some protection is advisable since transports are high-value targets, but excessive armor reduces transport capacity
- **Self-Defense:** Minimal point defense may be worthwhile, but combat capability should not be the priority
- **Fuel Range:** Ensure sufficient range for the planned deployment distance
- **Maintenance:** Include adequate maintenance supply storage for long deployments

**Practical Tips:**

- A common mistake is building a large army but insufficient transport capacity to deploy it
- Consider building several classes of transport: fast assault transports for the initial wave, and slower bulk transports for follow-up forces
- Keep transports in a separate task group from combat ships; they should withdraw if combat begins in orbit
- Pre-position transports near your army's marshaling point to reduce deployment time when an invasion is ordered

## 13.2.3 Drop Operations

Drop operations represent the ability to deploy ground forces from orbit directly to a planetary surface under combat conditions, bypassing the need for a secured landing zone. This is the most aggressive form of ground force deployment.

**Combat Drop Capability**

Combat drops require specialized equipment and training:

- **Drop-Capable Formations:** Only formations specifically designed with drop-capable elements can conduct orbital assault landings
- **Drop Module:** A specialized component that can be added to transport ships, enabling them to deploy troops under fire
- **Risk:** Combat drops carry inherent casualties; some elements may be lost during the descent regardless of enemy action
- **Speed:** Drops can be executed quickly, allowing rapid force deployment

**Orbital Assault Sequence**

A typical orbital assault operation proceeds as follows:

1. **Achieve Orbital Superiority:** Your fleet must control the orbital space above the target body. Enemy ships in orbit will engage your transports
2. **Suppress Defenses:** If the enemy has anti-aircraft elements or ground-to-orbit weapons, consider orbital bombardment to reduce them first (see Section 13.3.3)
3. **Execute Drop:** Issue the combat drop order to your transport task group. Drop-capable formations deploy to the surface
4. **Reinforce:** Once a beachhead is established, conventional (non-drop) formations can be unloaded normally
5. **Consolidate:** Landed forces should immediately begin fortifying their position

**Drop Casualties**

Combat drops are not without cost:

- A percentage of elements may be destroyed during the drop itself due to the inherent dangers of forced orbital entry
- Enemy anti-aircraft elements on the surface increase drop casualties significantly
- Larger, heavier elements (armor, vehicles) suffer proportionally more drop casualties than infantry
- Research in ground combat technology can reduce base drop casualty rates

**When to Use Drops vs. Conventional Landing**

| Situation | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Undefended or lightly defended body | Conventional landing (no drop casualties) |
| Heavily defended but you have orbital superiority | Orbital bombardment then conventional landing |
| Enemy has strong ground forces, you need surprise | Combat drop to establish beachhead |
| Time-critical objective | Combat drop for speed |
| Friendly forces already on surface | Conventional reinforcement landing |

**Practical Tips:**

- Do not use combat drops when a conventional landing is possible; the casualties are wasteful
- Infantry formations make the best drop troops due to low per-element transport weight and acceptable drop casualty rates
- Heavy armor is a poor choice for drop operations; the combination of high transport cost and high drop casualties makes conventional landing far more efficient for armored units
- Always achieve orbital superiority before attempting a drop; transports are extremely vulnerable to enemy warships
- Consider landing a recon formation first (via drop if necessary) to assess the ground situation before committing your main force
