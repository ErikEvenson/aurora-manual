# 13.1 Unit Types

Aurora's ground forces system allows you to design custom ground unit types from component elements, then build formations of those units to garrison colonies, invade enemy worlds, or defend against alien incursions. Unlike naval forces, ground units are designed at the formation level rather than the individual platform level, combining multiple elements into cohesive combat units.

## 13.1.1 Infantry

Infantry are the backbone of any ground force and represent personnel-heavy combat elements. They are relatively inexpensive to build, require minimal transport capacity, and are effective in defensive operations.

**Base Infantry Element**

The standard infantry element represents a squad-level unit of soldiers equipped with personal weapons. Infantry elements have the following characteristics:

- **Combat Strength:** Low per-element, but infantry formations contain many elements
- **Transport Size:** 1 ton per element (the smallest of any combat element)
- **Build Cost:** Minimal mineral requirements, primarily requiring only a small amount of Duranium
- **Hit Points:** Low individually, but formations absorb casualties across many elements

**Heavy Infantry**

Heavy infantry elements represent troops equipped with powered armor or heavy personal weapons. They cost more but provide significantly improved combat capability per element. Heavy infantry requires additional research in ground combat technology to unlock.

**Garrison Infantry**

Garrison infantry elements are a cost-effective option for static defense. They have reduced offensive capability compared to standard infantry but maintain full defensive strength at lower build cost. These are ideal for colony defense where you do not anticipate needing to transport the formation offworld.

**Practical Tips:**

- Infantry formations are your cheapest option for establishing a garrison presence on colonies
- The low transport size of infantry elements means you can move large formations without enormous fleets of troop transports
- In defensive combat, infantry benefits greatly from fortification bonuses (see Section 13.3.2)
- Consider mixing infantry with support elements rather than building pure infantry formations

## 13.1.2 Armor and Vehicles

Armored and vehicle elements represent ground combat platforms ranging from light reconnaissance vehicles to heavy battle tanks. These elements provide concentrated firepower and resilience but require significantly more transport capacity than infantry.

**Light Armored Vehicle**

Light armored vehicles serve as mobile fire support and reconnaissance platforms. They offer a balance between combat capability and transport requirements:

- **Combat Strength:** Moderate; significantly higher than infantry per element
- **Transport Size:** 50 tons per element
- **Build Cost:** Requires Duranium and some Mercassium
- **Role:** Mobile warfare, exploitation of breakthroughs

**Heavy Armor**

Heavy armor elements represent main battle tanks or their equivalent. They are the most powerful conventional ground combat element available:

- **Combat Strength:** High; dominates open ground combat
- **Transport Size:** 100 tons per element
- **Build Cost:** Significant Duranium and Mercassium requirements
- **Role:** Assault operations, breaking fortified positions

**Super Heavy Armor**

Available after researching advanced ground combat technology, super heavy armor represents the pinnacle of conventional ground combat capability. These massive platforms carry the heaviest weapons and thickest armor:

- **Combat Strength:** Very high
- **Transport Size:** 200 tons per element
- **Build Cost:** Extensive mineral requirements including Duranium, Mercassium, and Vendarite

**Practical Tips:**

- Armored formations are expensive to transport but provide decisive combat power during invasions
- Heavy and super heavy armor are most effective in offensive operations against fortified positions
- Balance your armored forces against transport capacity; a division of heavy tanks does no good sitting in orbit because you lack transport tonnage
- Armor elements suffer less from combat attrition per point of damage received, since each element represents substantial hit points

## 13.1.3 Support Units

Support elements provide essential combat multipliers, command and control, and specialized capabilities to ground formations. While they may not engage directly in frontline combat, their presence dramatically improves overall formation effectiveness.

**Headquarters Element**

HQ elements provide command and control bonuses to the formation they belong to. A formation without an HQ element suffers significant penalties to combat effectiveness:

- **Effect:** Provides a command bonus that multiplies the combat strength of all other elements in the formation
- **Transport Size:** 50 tons per element
- **Build Cost:** Requires Duranium and some electronics minerals (Boronide)
- **Key Point:** Every combat formation should include at least one HQ element

**Artillery Element**

Artillery elements provide long-range indirect fire support. In ground combat, they contribute bombardment strength that attacks the enemy before close combat is resolved:

- **Combat Strength:** Moderate direct, but high bombardment value
- **Transport Size:** 25-50 tons per element depending on caliber
- **Build Cost:** Requires Duranium and Gallicite
- **Role:** Softening enemy positions before assault, defensive fire support

**Engineer Element**

Engineers provide construction and fortification bonuses. When a formation containing engineers is ordered to fortify, the fortification level increases more rapidly:

- **Effect:** Increases fortification construction rate
- **Transport Size:** 25 tons per element
- **Build Cost:** Requires Duranium and Corbomite
- **Role:** Rapid fortification of captured positions, obstacle clearance

**Anti-Aircraft Element**

Anti-aircraft elements provide defense against orbital bombardment and close air support. They reduce the effectiveness of enemy ships conducting bombardment operations:

- **Effect:** Reduces damage from orbital bombardment targeting the formation
- **Transport Size:** 25 tons per element
- **Build Cost:** Requires Duranium, Uridium, and Gallicite
- **Role:** Protecting ground forces from space-based attack

**Practical Tips:**

- Never build a combat formation without at least one HQ element; the command bonus is essential
- Artillery is particularly valuable in defensive operations where the formation is fortified
- Engineers become critical when you are conducting an invasion and need to quickly fortify captured territory against counterattack
- Anti-aircraft elements are important if you expect to face an enemy with space superiority; without them, orbital bombardment can devastate your ground forces

## 13.1.4 Special Forces

Special forces elements represent elite units trained for unconventional warfare, deep reconnaissance, and precision strikes. They are expensive but provide unique capabilities that conventional forces cannot replicate.

**Commando Element**

Commando elements represent small teams of highly trained operators capable of conducting sabotage, direct action, and intelligence gathering:

- **Combat Strength:** Low in conventional battle, but high per-element
- **Transport Size:** 1 ton per element (same as infantry, representing small team size)
- **Build Cost:** Low in minerals but high in training time
- **Special Ability:** Can conduct raids against enemy installations and population

**Recon Element**

Reconnaissance elements provide intelligence about enemy ground forces on the same body. They reveal information about enemy formation composition and strength:

- **Effect:** Provides intelligence on enemy formations present on the same body
- **Transport Size:** 5 tons per element
- **Build Cost:** Moderate, requiring Duranium and some electronics minerals
- **Role:** Intelligence gathering before committing to ground assault

**Boarding Element**

Boarding elements are specialized for capturing enemy ships and orbital installations rather than ground combat. They are trained in zero-gravity combat and ship seizure operations:

- **Combat Strength:** Minimal in ground combat
- **Transport Size:** 1 ton per element
- **Build Cost:** Low mineral cost, specialized training
- **Role:** Ship boarding actions (see Section 12 for naval combat)

**Practical Tips:**

- Commando raids can disrupt enemy infrastructure even when you cannot win a conventional ground battle
- Always land recon elements before committing your main invasion force; knowing the enemy composition allows you to bring appropriate forces
- Boarding elements are a niche capability but can be invaluable for capturing enemy technology
- Special forces formations are best kept small; their value comes from precision rather than mass
- Consider creating mixed formations with a few commando elements embedded in conventional units for added flexibility
