# 13.1 Unit Types and Formation Design

Aurora's ground forces system uses a three-tier organizational hierarchy. Individual soldiers or vehicles are designed as **Ground Unit Classes**. These are combined into **Formation Elements** (groups of identical unit classes). Multiple Formation Elements then compose a **Formation**, which moves as a cohesive unit but breaks down into individual elements during combat. Formation Templates serve as blueprints (analogous to ship classes) from which formations are constructed.

## 13.1.1 Ground Unit Class Design

Ground Unit Classes are the fundamental building blocks of all ground forces. Each unit class is designed by selecting a base type, adding components to available slots, selecting armor levels, and optionally choosing combat capabilities.

### Base Types

Each base type has inherent attributes affecting survivability, mobility, and component capacity:

| Base Type | Slots | Self-Fortification | Max Fortification | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Infantry | 1 | 3 | 6 | Smallest, cheapest, most versatile |
| Light Vehicle | 1 | 2 | 3 | Mobile fire support |
| Standard Vehicle | 1 | 2 | 3 | General-purpose platform |
| Heavy Vehicle | 2 | 2 | 3 | Main battle tank equivalent |
| Super-Heavy Vehicle | 3 | 1.5 | 2 | Heavy assault platform |
| Ultra-Heavy Vehicle | 4 | 1.25 | 1.5 | Maximum firepower platform |
| Static Weapon | - | 3 | 6 | Immobile; towed guns, artillery emplacements |

**Key Attributes per Base Type:**

- **Size (tons):** Determines transportation requirements and serves as cost foundation. Modifiers apply based on components and armament selections.
- **Hit Points:** Used in destruction calculations. When hit, destruction probability = (Weapon Damage / Hit Points)^2.
- **Slots:** Component mounting capacity (1-4 depending on base type).
- **To-Hit Modifier:** Reflects unit mobility; mobile units are harder to hit. Static units suffer increased hit probability. Fortified units ignore this penalty.
- **Maximum Fortification:** Highest defensive level achievable with construction support. Divides incoming accuracy by this value.
- **Maximum Self-Fortification:** Defensive capability achievable without external construction assistance.

### Armor System

Armor uses comparative analysis rather than absolute values:

- **Base Armor Rating:** Multiplied by unit size to calculate construction cost. A unit with 6 armor costs 50% more than an identical unit with 4 armor.
- **Racial Armor Rating:** Base rating multiplied by the faction's highest armor technology level. Technologies progress through: Conventional (3), Duranium (5), and higher tiers through advanced ceramics and composites.
- **Armor Penetration Calculation:** When a weapon hits, penetration probability = (Armor Penetration / Armor)^2. If AP >= Armor, penetration is automatic.

### Component System

Components mount in available slots and determine unit specialization. Each component has the following attributes:

- **Size Contribution:** Added to base unit tonnage
- **Armor-Penetration Rating:** Multiplied by Racial Weapon Strength
- **Damage Value:** Multiplied by Racial Weapon Strength
- **Fire Rate:** Shots per combat phase
- **CIWS Capability:** Designates Close-In Weapon System components for planetary missile defense
- **STO Functionality:** Surface-To-Orbit energy weapons capable of engaging orbital vessels within range
- **Headquarters Capacity:** Tons of formation controllable by a unit-based commander
- **Forward Fire Direction (FFD):** Enables coordination of support unit fire, ground support fighters, and orbital bombardment
- **Construction Value:** Measured in Construction Factory Equivalents (CFEs) for fortification work

Certain components are restricted to specific base types. For example, Super-Heavy Anti-Vehicle weapons can only mount on super-heavy or ultra-heavy platforms.

### Ground Support Points (GSP) Formula

Ground Support Points measure a weapon component's overall combat effectiveness. The formula is:

```
GSP = Penetration Value x Damage Value x Shots
```

**GSP Examples by Component Type:**

| Component | Penetration | Damage | Shots | GSP |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|-----|
| Personal Weapons | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Crew Served AP | 1 | 1 | 6 | 6 |
| Medium Anti-Vehicle | 4 | 6 | 1 | 24 |
| Heavy Bombardment | 2 | 6 | 3 | 36 |

GSP provides a standardized comparison metric across weapon types. Higher GSP indicates greater total combat output per element, though the distribution between penetration, damage, and rate of fire affects tactical suitability against different target types (e.g., high penetration matters more vs. armored vehicles, while high shots matter more vs. infantry).

### Research Costs

Ground combat technologies (see [Section 7.4 Tech Categories](../7-research/7.4-tech-categories.md)) have reduced research costs (as of v2.2.0) compared to earlier versions. The general pattern is approximately 50% reduction from prior costs, making ground force development more accessible earlier in campaigns:

**Starting Technologies (Conventional Start):**

| Technology | Research Cost (RP) |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Troop Transport Bay | 1,000 |
| Troop Transport Boarding Bay | 2,500 |
| Troop Transport Drop Bay | 2,500 |

**Equipment and Capabilities (2,500 RP each):**
- Geosurvey Equipment, Construction Equipment, Xenoarchaeology Equipment
- Fighter Pods (Autocannon, Bombardment, Air-to-Air)
- Ground unit capabilities (Boarding, Desert, High-Gravity, etc.)

**Vehicle Armor Progression:**

| Armor Tier | Research Cost (RP) | Prerequisite (v2.4.0+) |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Heavy Armor | 2,500 | Heavy Vehicle type |
| Super-Heavy Armor | 5,000 | Super-Heavy Vehicle type |
| Ultra-Heavy Armor | 10,000 | Ultra-Heavy Vehicle type |

As of v2.4.0, the Heavy, Super-Heavy, and Ultra-Heavy Vehicle base types are prerequisites for researching their respective armor tiers. You must have access to the vehicle type before you can research the corresponding armor technology.

**Weapons Systems:**
- Most bombardment, anti-vehicle, and anti-air weapons: 2,500 RP
- Super-heavy weapon variants: 5,000 RP

### Racial Strength Modifiers

Two fundamental racial metrics govern equipment effectiveness:

- **Racial Armor Strength:** Derived from the highest armor technology tier researched. Conventional = 3; Duranium = 5; progression continues through advanced materials.
- **Racial Weapon Strength:** Based on the maximum tech level across laser focal sizes, railgun types, meson focal sizes, particle beam strength, and carronade caliber. This links weapon and armor development so they scale together.

### Combat Capabilities

Optional specializations that double targeting accuracy within designated terrain or tactical scenarios. Available capabilities include:

- **Mountain Warfare:** 0.5x modifier in mountain/rift valley terrain
- **Jungle Warfare:** 0.5x modifier in jungle/rainforest terrain
- **Desert Warfare:** 0.5x modifier in desert/arid terrain
- **Boarding Combat:** Required for ship boarding operations; doubles boarding success probability

Multiple capabilities stack multiplicatively. A unit with both Mountain and Jungle Warfare gains a 0.25x modifier (4x accuracy) in jungle-mountain terrain.

Each capability selection increases unit cost proportionally.

### Genetically Enhanced Soldiers

Infantry units can receive genetic enhancement through Biology/Genetics technology research. Three tiers are available after completing Genome Sequence Research:

| Enhancement Tier | Research Cost (RP) | HP Multiplier | Cost Multiplier |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Basic Enhancement | 5,000 | x1.25 | x1.5 |
| Improved Enhancement | 10,000 | x1.6 | x2.0 |
| Advanced Enhancement | 20,000 | x2.0 | x2.5 |

Enhancements provide multiplicative bonuses to hit points, making soldiers substantially more resilient. These are selected as capabilities during unit design.

### Class Design Highlighting

The Ground Unit Class design interface provides visual indicators to identify outdated or alien-origin components:

**Component-Level Highlighting (in the class treeview):**
- **Orange:** Obsolete components (superseded by newer research)
- **Red:** Components where the owning race lacks research data (typically alien-origin)

**Class-Level Highlighting:**
- An "Obsolete Comp" checkbox below the class treeview enables class-level visualization
- **Orange classes** contain at least one obsolete component
- **Red classes** contain non-researched (alien) components
- The Race Components list also shows obsolete components in orange when the Obsolete checkbox is enabled

In longer games, most classes will contain obsolete components, so the checkbox-based filtering helps players quickly identify which designs need updating.

### Design Constraints

- Armor, hit points, and components freeze at design-time technology levels and do not automatically upgrade when superior technology becomes available (similar to naval ship design).
- Research must establish baseline technology for components before they become available.
- Construction cost in Build Points incorporates size, armor selection, component choices, and selected capabilities.

## 13.1.2 Infantry

Infantry represent personnel-heavy combat elements. They are inexpensive, require minimal transport capacity, and excel in defensive operations. Infantry is the only base type that can receive genetic enhancements and use the Small Logistics Module.

**Characteristics:**
- 1 component slot
- Self-fortification to level 3; maximum fortification level 6 with construction support
- Smallest transport size (lowest tonnage per element)
- Lowest individual hit points but formations contain many elements
- Can carry Small Logistics Modules (10 tons, 100 GSP) for self-supply

**Infantry Variants by Component Choice:**
- **Standard Infantry:** Anti-personnel weapons; effective against other infantry
- **Heavy Infantry:** Anti-vehicle weapons mounted; effective against armored targets
- **Garrison Infantry:** Reduced offensive capability, full defensive strength at lower cost
- **Combat Engineers:** Construction components for fortification work
- **Logistics Infantry:** Small Logistics Modules for formation supply (can only supply own formation)
- **HQ Infantry:** Headquarters components for command and control
- **AA Infantry:** Anti-aircraft components for air defense
- **STO Infantry:** Surface-to-orbit weapons for engaging orbital targets

## 13.1.3 Vehicles and Armor

Vehicle elements represent ground combat platforms ranging from light reconnaissance to ultra-heavy assault vehicles. They provide concentrated firepower and resilience but require significantly more transport capacity than infantry.

### Light Vehicles

- 1 component slot
- Self-fortification to level 2; maximum fortification level 3
- Can mount Standard Logistics Modules (50 tons, 500 GSP)
- Vehicle-based logistics can supply other formations (unlike infantry logistics)
- Mobile fire support and reconnaissance role

### Standard Vehicles

- 1 component slot
- Self-fortification to level 2; maximum fortification level 3
- General-purpose combat platform
- Balance of firepower, protection, and transport cost

### Heavy Vehicles

- 2 component slots
- Self-fortification to level 2; maximum fortification level 3
- Main battle tank equivalent with dual weapon mounts
- Significant transport tonnage requirement

### Super-Heavy Vehicles

- 3 component slots
- Self-fortification to level 1.5; maximum fortification level 2
- Can mount Super-Heavy Anti-Vehicle weapons (restricted to this tier and above)
- Very high transport cost
- Reduced fortification capability reflects difficulty of concealing large platforms

### Ultra-Heavy Vehicles

- 4 component slots
- Self-fortification to level 1.25; maximum fortification level 1.5
- Maximum firepower potential with 4 weapon/component mounts
- Enormous transport requirement
- Minimal fortification ability; these platforms rely on armor and firepower rather than concealment

### Static Weapons

- Immobile platforms (towed guns, artillery emplacements)
- Self-fortification to level 3; maximum fortification level 6
- Suffer increased hit probability due to immobility
- Cannot relocate without being loaded onto transport
- Excellent for permanent defensive positions

## 13.1.4 Support Units

Support elements provide essential combat multipliers, command and control, logistics, and specialized capabilities. Their presence dramatically improves overall formation effectiveness.

### Headquarters Elements

HQ components provide command capacity measured in tons of formation controllable. A formation without adequate HQ capacity suffers proportional penalties to effectiveness.

- Every combat formation should include HQ elements
- HQ capacity must match or exceed the total tonnage of the formation commanded
- If commanding forces exceed HQ capacity, bonus effectiveness reduces proportionally

### Forward Fire Direction (FFD) Elements

FFD components coordinate external fire support:

- Each FFD component permits support from up to 6 ground support fighters
- Each FFD component also enables 1 orbital bombardment support ship
- Without FFD, formations cannot receive fighter or orbital fire support
- If a formation loses FFD capability during combat, assigned support ships automatically seek alternative formations

### Artillery / Bombardment Elements

Artillery provides indirect fire support from the Support field position:

- Fires simultaneously with ground support fighters and orbital bombardment
- Cannot directly attack from the support position but provides bombardment
- Target selection options match heavy bombardment parameters
- Effectiveness improved by commander's Ground Combat Artillery (GCA) bonus

**Super-Heavy Bombardment (v2.0+):** As of v2.0, a Super-Heavy Bombardment ground component is available, providing a larger and more destructive bombardment option beyond standard heavy bombardment. This gives ground forces access to extremely powerful indirect fire support at the cost of increased transport tonnage and build points.

### Construction Elements

Construction-equipped units enable fortification beyond self-fortification limits:

- Construction capacity = construction rating x unit count x racial construction rating x commander bonus x 100 tons
- Can fortify other elements from self-fortification maximum to absolute maximum in 90 days (given sufficient capacity)
- Only works on elements already at their self-fortification maximum
- Essential for achieving maximum fortification levels on vehicles

### Anti-Aircraft Elements

AA elements defend against ground support fighters:

- Participate in normal ground combat using standard values
- Can draw supply twice if engaged in both ground-to-ground and ground-to-air combat
- Targeting formula: (10% x (Tracking Speed / Aircraft Speed) x (Morale / 100)) / Environment Modifier
- Damage against aircraft: ((Ground Damage Value / 20)^2) rounded down
- All AA damage applies after all attacks resolve in combat sequence

**AA Targeting Priority:**
1. AA units in a formation directly attacked by aircraft each select a random attacking aircraft
2. Medium/Heavy AA in parent formations target aircraft engaging subordinates
3. Heavy AA units engage random hostile aircraft, including those on combat air patrol

### CIWS Elements

Close-In Weapon System components provide planetary missile defense, protecting the colony from incoming missile attacks.

### STO (Surface-to-Orbit) Elements

STO-designated energy weapons can engage orbital vessels within range:

- Tracking speed and ECCM can be updated when formation templates are copied/updated
- Provides ground-based defense against ships in orbit
- Makes orbital bombardment riskier for attacking fleets

### Logistics Elements

Two logistics component types provide battlefield supply:

| Module Type | Size (tons) | GSP Provided | Mountable On |
|------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Standard Logistics Module | 50 | 500 | Light vehicles and larger |
| Small Logistics Module | 10 | 100 | Infantry only |

- Vehicle-based logistics can supply other formations
- Infantry-based logistics can only supply their own formation
- Logistics vehicles are consumed as supply is drawn

### Decontamination Elements

A specialized component for radiation reduction:
- Same size/cost as Xenoarchaeology components
- Mountable on medium or larger vehicles
- Each component increases radiation reduction by 0.01% per year
- Commanders can gain rare Decontamination bonus

## 13.1.5 Formation Templates

Formation Templates function analogously to naval ship classes, serving as blueprints from which formations are constructed. Templates comprise multiple Template Elements, each specifying quantities of particular Ground Unit Classes.

### Template Structure

Each Template Element tracks:
- Unit class designation
- Quantity of units
- Aggregate tonnage and build point cost
- Combined hit points
- Headquarters capacity
- Forward Fire Direction component counts
- CIWS and STO weapon quantities
- Construction value in CFEs

Template-level totals aggregate across all constituent elements, establishing transport requirements and resource expenditures for complete formation construction.

### Rank Assignment

Templates receive a default rank suggested by the program, although this can be overridden by the player. This rank is used by the Automated Assignment process for formations built using the template.

### Ordinal Numbering (v1.13.0+)

Formation templates use per-template ordinal numbering rather than a unified sequence. Each template type maintains its own independent counter:

- **Per-Template Basis:** The 1st Infantry Regiment and 1st Armoured Regiment are numbered independently
- **Roman Numeral Option:** A "Use Roman" checkbox enables Roman numeral suffixes (e.g., Infantry Regiment I, Infantry Regiment II, Infantry Regiment III)
- **Sort by Creation:** Since Roman numerals do not sort alphabetically well, a "Sort Creation" option on the Ground Design and Economics windows sorts units by creation order rather than alphabetically when they share the same abbreviation

### Template Management

- **Copy + Upgrade (v2.2.1):** Previously named "Copy + Update" (v2.2.0), this button creates evolved formation templates by duplicating them with year suffixes and automatically generating upgraded unit classes when racial armor/weapon modifiers, tracking speed, or ECCM values have changed. The upgraded unit classes are organized into Unit Series for automated replacement. Renamed in v2.2.1 to better reflect its purpose of creating upgraded versions and updating the Organization tab.
- **Copy Temp (v2.2.1):** Duplicates templates without modifying unit classes. Use this when you want an exact copy of a template for organizational purposes without triggering the automatic unit class upgrade process.
- **Element Management:** Players can add, edit quantities, and delete elements or entire templates.
- **Drag-and-Drop Creation:** Elements can be dragged from existing formations to create new formations on the Order of Battle tab.

### Creating Formations from Elements

Players can create new formations by dragging element nodes from existing formations to population nodes on the Order of Battle tab:

1. **Drag** an element node from an existing formation to a population node
2. **Enter Name:** A popup appears requesting the new formation name
3. **Enter Abbreviation:** A second popup requests the formation abbreviation
4. **Optional Amount:** If the "Amount Popup" checkbox is enabled, a third dialog allows specifying the quantity to transfer (e.g., transfer 40 of 120 tanks to create a smaller formation)
5. **Result:** A new formation is created containing only the transferred elements

**Location Requirement:** The target population must be on the same system body as the source formation (unless Spacemaster mode is active, which permits transfers to any population).

This feature enables tactical restructuring and splitting of formations without requiring complete reformation procedures.

### Design Guidelines

When designing formation templates, consider:

- **Transport Budget:** Total tonnage determines transport ship requirements (see [Section 13.2 Training and Transport](13.2-training-and-transport.md))
- **Command Coverage:** Include sufficient HQ capacity for the formation's total tonnage
- **FFD Coverage:** Include FFD elements if you want fighter or orbital bombardment support
- **Supply Autonomy:** Include logistics elements for sustained combat (each unit has inherent supply for only 10 combat rounds)
- **Construction Support:** Include construction elements if the formation needs to fortify vehicle elements beyond self-fortification levels
- **Balance:** Mix combat types (anti-personnel, anti-vehicle) based on expected threats

## 13.1.6 Unit Series

Unit Series provide an organizational mechanism for grouping similar unit designs across technology generations, enabling the automated replacement system to substitute upgraded versions without requiring template modifications.

### Purpose

When a formation takes casualties and needs replacement units, the system uses Unit Series to determine which unit class to provide. Rather than requiring the exact same unit class specified in the original template, the system selects the most current unit from the matching Unit Series.

### Management

- Unit Series are managed through a dedicated tab using drag-and-drop functionality
- Similar unit designs (e.g., successive generations of a rifle infantry class) are grouped into the same series
- When replacements occur, the system uses the Unit Series of each unit in the Replacement Template rather than the specific unit class
- This enables automatic substitution with upgraded versions without requiring template updates

### Example

If "Rifle Infantry Mk I" and "Rifle Infantry Mk II" are in the same Unit Series, formations originally built with Mk I will receive Mk II replacements when available, automatically upgrading the formation composition over time.

## 13.1.7 Ground Force Organizations

Formations can be organized hierarchically:

- Parent formations can contain subordinate formations
- Logistics supply draws from higher formation levels first, checking at each hierarchy stage
- Commander bonuses apply through the hierarchy based on command capacity
- Elements can be reorganized between formations at the same location

### Element Transfer Between Formations

The system uses an intelligent drag-and-drop interface for transferring elements between formations:

- **Whole Element Transfer:** By default, dragging an element to a new formation transfers the entire element. If the receiving formation already contains units of the same class, the additional units merge with the existing element.
- **Partial Transfer:** Enable the "Amount" checkbox to transfer only a portion of an element. A popup box appears after the drag-drop allowing specification of how many units to move.
- **Location Constraint:** Units must be on the same system body to transfer between formations (prevents cross-planetary transfers).
- **Hierarchy Display:** Formation elements are shown under their own node in the hierarchy tree to avoid clutter.

### Scrapping Formations (v1.14.0+)

Formations that are no longer needed can be scrapped for partial resource recovery:

- **Process:** Select a formation in the Ground Forces window and click the "Scrap Formation" button
- **Resource Recovery:** Yields 30% of the formation's original wealth and mineral value
- **Wealth:** Recovered wealth is added to the racial balance
- **Minerals:** Recovered minerals are added to the parent population's stockpile
- **Scope:** All elements within the formation are scrapped together (cannot scrap individual elements this way)

### Class Default Ground Forces

Ship classes can be assigned default ground force formations (similar to ordnance loadouts and strikegroup assignments):

- **Assignment:** Ship classes receive default ground forces assignments during design
- **Automatic Loading:** When a ship is built, the system searches for matching ground formations at the same population as the shipyard
- **Eligibility Criteria:** Formations must match the required template, be at full strength with no losses, and be stationed at the same population
- **Instant Loading:** Qualifying formations load instantly (same mechanism as ordnance loading)
- **Instant Build Integration:** When using instant build with the "Include Assigned Templates" checkbox enabled, all default ground formation templates are created immediately and loaded into transport bays

**Instant Organisation (v2.3.1+):**

The Instant Organisation feature (SpaceMaster tool for immediately creating formations) now consumes build points as of v2.3.1. Previously, instant formations were created without resource cost; they now deduct the appropriate BP from the colony's available build points, maintaining economic balance even when using this convenience feature.

**Ground Unit Cost:** Calculated using size, armor, components, and capabilities, rounded to 3 decimal places for precision in build point allocation.
