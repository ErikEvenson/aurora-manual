# 13.1 Unit Types and Formation Design

Aurora's ground forces system uses a three-tier organizational hierarchy. Individual soldiers or vehicles are designed as **Ground Unit Classes**. These are combined into **Formation Elements** (groups of identical unit classes). Multiple Formation Elements then compose a **Formation**, which moves as a cohesive unit but breaks down into individual elements during combat. Formation Templates serve as blueprints (analogous to ship classes) from which formations are constructed.

## 13.1.1 Ground Unit Class Design

Ground Unit Classes are the fundamental building blocks of all ground forces. Each unit class is designed by selecting a base type, adding components to available slots, selecting armor levels, and optionally choosing combat capabilities.

### Base Types

Each base type has inherent attributes affecting survivability, mobility, and component capacity:

| Base Type | Slots | Self-Fortification | Max Fortification | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Infantry | 1 | 3 | 6 | Smallest, cheapest, most versatile |
| Light Vehicle | 1 | 2 | 3 | Mobile fire support |
| Standard Vehicle | 1 | 2 | 3 | General-purpose platform |
| Heavy Vehicle | 2 | 2 | 3 | Main battle tank equivalent |
| Super-Heavy Vehicle | 3 | 1.5 | 2 | Heavy assault platform |
| Ultra-Heavy Vehicle | 4 | 1.25 | 1.5 | Maximum firepower platform |
| Static Weapon | - | 3 | 6 | Immobile; towed guns, artillery emplacements |

**Key Attributes per Base Type:**

- **Size (tons):** Determines transportation requirements and serves as cost foundation. Modifiers apply based on components and armament selections.
- **Hit Points:** Used in destruction calculations. When hit, destruction probability = (Weapon Damage / Hit Points)^2.
- **Slots:** Component mounting capacity (1-4 depending on base type).
- **To-Hit Modifier:** Reflects unit mobility; mobile units are harder to hit. Static units suffer increased hit probability. Fortified units ignore this penalty.
- **Maximum Fortification:** Highest defensive level achievable with construction support. Divides incoming accuracy by this value.
- **Maximum Self-Fortification:** Defensive capability achievable without external construction assistance.

### Armor System

Armor uses comparative analysis rather than absolute values:

- **Base Armor Rating:** Multiplied by unit size to calculate construction cost. A unit with 6 armor costs 50% more than an identical unit with 4 armor.
- **Racial Armor Rating:** Base rating multiplied by the faction's highest armor technology level. Technologies progress through: Conventional (3), Duranium (5), and higher tiers through advanced ceramics and composites.
- **Armor Penetration Calculation:** When a weapon hits, penetration probability = (Armor Penetration / Armor)^2. If AP >= Armor, penetration is automatic.

### Component System

Components mount in available slots and determine unit specialization. Each component has the following attributes:

- **Size Contribution:** Added to base unit tonnage
- **Armor-Penetration Rating:** Multiplied by Racial Weapon Strength
- **Damage Value:** Multiplied by Racial Weapon Strength
- **Fire Rate:** Shots per combat phase
- **CIWS Capability:** Designates Close-In Weapon System components for planetary missile defense
- **STO Functionality:** Surface-To-Orbit energy weapons capable of engaging orbital vessels within range
- **Headquarters Capacity:** Tons of formation controllable by a unit-based commander
- **Forward Fire Direction (FFD):** Enables coordination of support unit fire, ground support fighters, and orbital bombardment
- **Construction Value:** Measured in Construction Factory Equivalents (CFEs) for fortification work

Certain components are restricted to specific base types. For example, Super-Heavy Anti-Vehicle weapons can only mount on super-heavy or ultra-heavy platforms.

### Racial Strength Modifiers

Two fundamental racial metrics govern equipment effectiveness:

- **Racial Armor Strength:** Derived from the highest armor technology tier researched. Conventional = 3; Duranium = 5; progression continues through advanced materials.
- **Racial Weapon Strength:** Based on the maximum tech level across laser focal sizes, railgun types, meson focal sizes, particle beam strength, and carronade caliber. This links weapon and armor development so they scale together.

### Combat Capabilities

Optional specializations that double targeting accuracy within designated terrain or tactical scenarios. Available capabilities include:

- **Mountain Warfare:** 0.5x modifier in mountain/rift valley terrain
- **Jungle Warfare:** 0.5x modifier in jungle/rainforest terrain
- **Desert Warfare:** 0.5x modifier in desert/arid terrain
- **Boarding Combat:** Required for ship boarding operations; doubles boarding success probability

Multiple capabilities stack multiplicatively. A unit with both Mountain and Jungle Warfare gains a 0.25x modifier (4x accuracy) in jungle-mountain terrain.

Each capability selection increases unit cost proportionally.

### Genetically Enhanced Soldiers

Infantry units can receive genetic enhancement through Biology/Genetics technology research. Three tiers are available after completing Genome Sequence Research:

| Enhancement Tier | Research Cost (RP) | HP Multiplier | Cost Multiplier |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Basic Enhancement | 5,000 | x1.25 | x1.5 |
| Improved Enhancement | 10,000 | x1.6 | x2.0 |
| Advanced Enhancement | 20,000 | x2.0 | x2.5 |

Enhancements provide multiplicative bonuses to hit points, making soldiers substantially more resilient. These are selected as capabilities during unit design.

### Design Constraints

- Armor, hit points, and components freeze at design-time technology levels and do not automatically upgrade when superior technology becomes available (similar to naval ship design).
- Research must establish baseline technology for components before they become available.
- Construction cost in Build Points incorporates size, armor selection, component choices, and selected capabilities.

## 13.1.2 Infantry

Infantry represent personnel-heavy combat elements. They are inexpensive, require minimal transport capacity, and excel in defensive operations. Infantry is the only base type that can receive genetic enhancements and use the Small Logistics Module.

**Characteristics:**
- 1 component slot
- Self-fortification to level 3; maximum fortification level 6 with construction support
- Smallest transport size (lowest tonnage per element)
- Lowest individual hit points but formations contain many elements
- Can carry Small Logistics Modules (10 tons, 100 GSP) for self-supply

**Infantry Variants by Component Choice:**
- **Standard Infantry:** Anti-personnel weapons; effective against other infantry
- **Heavy Infantry:** Anti-vehicle weapons mounted; effective against armored targets
- **Garrison Infantry:** Reduced offensive capability, full defensive strength at lower cost
- **Combat Engineers:** Construction components for fortification work
- **Logistics Infantry:** Small Logistics Modules for formation supply (can only supply own formation)
- **HQ Infantry:** Headquarters components for command and control
- **AA Infantry:** Anti-aircraft components for air defense
- **STO Infantry:** Surface-to-orbit weapons for engaging orbital targets

## 13.1.3 Vehicles and Armor

Vehicle elements represent ground combat platforms ranging from light reconnaissance to ultra-heavy assault vehicles. They provide concentrated firepower and resilience but require significantly more transport capacity than infantry.

### Light Vehicles

- 1 component slot
- Self-fortification to level 2; maximum fortification level 3
- Can mount Standard Logistics Modules (50 tons, 500 GSP)
- Vehicle-based logistics can supply other formations (unlike infantry logistics)
- Mobile fire support and reconnaissance role

### Standard Vehicles

- 1 component slot
- Self-fortification to level 2; maximum fortification level 3
- General-purpose combat platform
- Balance of firepower, protection, and transport cost

### Heavy Vehicles

- 2 component slots
- Self-fortification to level 2; maximum fortification level 3
- Main battle tank equivalent with dual weapon mounts
- Significant transport tonnage requirement

### Super-Heavy Vehicles

- 3 component slots
- Self-fortification to level 1.5; maximum fortification level 2
- Can mount Super-Heavy Anti-Vehicle weapons (restricted to this tier and above)
- Very high transport cost
- Reduced fortification capability reflects difficulty of concealing large platforms

### Ultra-Heavy Vehicles

- 4 component slots
- Self-fortification to level 1.25; maximum fortification level 1.5
- Maximum firepower potential with 4 weapon/component mounts
- Enormous transport requirement
- Minimal fortification ability; these platforms rely on armor and firepower rather than concealment

### Static Weapons

- Immobile platforms (towed guns, artillery emplacements)
- Self-fortification to level 3; maximum fortification level 6
- Suffer increased hit probability due to immobility
- Cannot relocate without being loaded onto transport
- Excellent for permanent defensive positions

## 13.1.4 Support Units

Support elements provide essential combat multipliers, command and control, logistics, and specialized capabilities. Their presence dramatically improves overall formation effectiveness.

### Headquarters Elements

HQ components provide command capacity measured in tons of formation controllable. A formation without adequate HQ capacity suffers proportional penalties to effectiveness.

- Every combat formation should include HQ elements
- HQ capacity must match or exceed the total tonnage of the formation commanded
- If commanding forces exceed HQ capacity, bonus effectiveness reduces proportionally

### Forward Fire Direction (FFD) Elements

FFD components coordinate external fire support:

- Each FFD component permits support from up to 6 ground support fighters
- Each FFD component also enables 1 orbital bombardment support ship
- Without FFD, formations cannot receive fighter or orbital fire support
- If a formation loses FFD capability during combat, assigned support ships automatically seek alternative formations

### Artillery / Bombardment Elements

Artillery provides indirect fire support from the Support field position:

- Fires simultaneously with ground support fighters and orbital bombardment
- Cannot directly attack from the support position but provides bombardment
- Target selection options match heavy bombardment parameters
- Effectiveness improved by commander's Ground Combat Artillery (GCA) bonus

### Construction Elements

Construction-equipped units enable fortification beyond self-fortification limits:

- Construction capacity = construction rating x unit count x racial construction rating x commander bonus x 100 tons
- Can fortify other elements from self-fortification maximum to absolute maximum in 90 days (given sufficient capacity)
- Only works on elements already at their self-fortification maximum
- Essential for achieving maximum fortification levels on vehicles

### Anti-Aircraft Elements

AA elements defend against ground support fighters:

- Participate in normal ground combat using standard values
- Can draw supply twice if engaged in both ground-to-ground and ground-to-air combat
- Targeting formula: (10% x (Tracking Speed / Aircraft Speed) x (Morale / 100)) / Environment Modifier
- Damage against aircraft: ((Ground Damage Value / 20)^2) rounded down
- All AA damage applies after all attacks resolve in combat sequence

**AA Targeting Priority:**
1. AA units in a formation directly attacked by aircraft each select a random attacking aircraft
2. Medium/Heavy AA in parent formations target aircraft engaging subordinates
3. Heavy AA units engage random hostile aircraft, including those on combat air patrol

### CIWS Elements

Close-In Weapon System components provide planetary missile defense, protecting the colony from incoming missile attacks.

### STO (Surface-to-Orbit) Elements

STO-designated energy weapons can engage orbital vessels within range:

- Tracking speed and ECCM can be updated when formation templates are copied/updated
- Provides ground-based defense against ships in orbit
- Makes orbital bombardment riskier for attacking fleets

### Logistics Elements

Two logistics component types provide battlefield supply:

| Module Type | Size (tons) | GSP Provided | Mountable On |
|------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Standard Logistics Module | 50 | 500 | Light vehicles and larger |
| Small Logistics Module | 10 | 100 | Infantry only |

- Vehicle-based logistics can supply other formations
- Infantry-based logistics can only supply their own formation
- Logistics vehicles are consumed as supply is drawn

### Decontamination Elements

A specialized component for radiation reduction:
- Same size/cost as Xenoarchaeology components
- Mountable on medium or larger vehicles
- Each component increases radiation reduction by 0.01% per year
- Commanders can gain rare Decontamination bonus

## 13.1.5 Formation Templates

Formation Templates function analogously to naval ship classes, serving as blueprints from which formations are constructed. Templates comprise multiple Template Elements, each specifying quantities of particular Ground Unit Classes.

### Template Structure

Each Template Element tracks:
- Unit class designation
- Quantity of units
- Aggregate tonnage and build point cost
- Combined hit points
- Headquarters capacity
- Forward Fire Direction component counts
- CIWS and STO weapon quantities
- Construction value in CFEs

Template-level totals aggregate across all constituent elements, establishing transport requirements and resource expenditures for complete formation construction.

### Rank Assignment

Templates receive a default rank suggested by the program, although this can be overridden by the player. This rank is used by the Automated Assignment process for formations built using the template.

### Template Management

- **Copy + Update:** Duplicates templates with year suffixes and automatically updates ground unit classes based on changes to racial armor/weapon modifiers, tracking speed, or ECCM improvements for STO elements.
- **Element Management:** Players can add, edit quantities, and delete elements or entire templates.
- **Drag-and-Drop Creation:** Elements can be dragged from existing formations to create new formations on the Order of Battle tab.

### Design Guidelines

When designing formation templates, consider:

- **Transport Budget:** Total tonnage determines transport ship requirements
- **Command Coverage:** Include sufficient HQ capacity for the formation's total tonnage
- **FFD Coverage:** Include FFD elements if you want fighter or orbital bombardment support
- **Supply Autonomy:** Include logistics elements for sustained combat (each unit has inherent supply for only 10 combat rounds)
- **Construction Support:** Include construction elements if the formation needs to fortify vehicle elements beyond self-fortification levels
- **Balance:** Mix combat types (anti-personnel, anti-vehicle) based on expected threats

## 13.1.6 Ground Force Organizations

Formations can be organized hierarchically:

- Parent formations can contain subordinate formations
- Logistics supply draws from higher formation levels first, checking at each hierarchy stage
- Commander bonuses apply through the hierarchy based on command capacity
- Elements can be reorganized between formations at the same location

**Ground Unit Cost:** Calculated using size, armor, components, and capabilities, rounded to 3 decimal places for precision in build point allocation.
