# 2.3 System Generation

## 2.3.1 Star Types and Distribution

Aurora generates star systems with attention to astrophysical plausibility. Each star system is created when discovered (through jump point transit) or at game start, with properties that affect habitability, resource availability, and strategic value.

**Stellar Classification**: Stars are classified using the standard spectral type system:

| Class | Color | Temperature | Frequency | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| O | Blue | 30,000K+ | Very Rare | Extremely luminous, short-lived |
| B | Blue-White | 10,000-30,000K | Rare | Hot, luminous |
| A | White | 7,500-10,000K | Uncommon | Bright, moderate habitable zones |
| F | Yellow-White | 6,000-7,500K | Moderate | Good habitable zone candidates |
| G | Yellow | 5,200-6,000K | Moderate | Sun-like, excellent for habitable worlds |
| K | Orange | 3,700-5,200K | Common | Cooler, closer habitable zones |
| M | Red | 2,400-3,700K | Very Common | Red dwarfs, most numerous |

**Star Distribution**: Following real astrophysical proportions, most generated systems feature M-class red dwarfs. G-class stars (like Sol) are relatively uncommon. This means truly Earth-like habitable zones are not guaranteed in every system you explore.

**Multiple Star Systems**: Systems can contain multiple stars in binary or trinary configurations. These multi-star systems affect:
- Orbital stability of planets (some orbits are unstable in multi-star systems)
- Habitable zone calculations (affected by combined luminosity)
- System size and jump point distribution
- Overall mineral availability (more stars often means more orbital bodies)

**Star Properties Affecting Gameplay**:
- **Luminosity**: Determines the habitable zone distance — where liquid water can exist on a planet's surface. More luminous stars have habitable zones farther out.
- **Star Type**: Affects the probability of terrestrial vs. gas giant planets and overall system composition.
- **System Age**: Older systems may have different mineral distributions and planetary compositions.

## 2.3.2 Orbital Bodies

Each star system contains a procedurally generated collection of planets, dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. These bodies are your primary targets for colonization and resource extraction.

**Planet Types**:

- **Terrestrial Planets**: Rocky worlds ranging from Mercury-sized to super-Earths. These are the primary colonization targets. They have defined atmospheres, temperatures, gravity, and surface conditions.
- **Gas Giants**: Jupiter-like worlds that cannot be colonized in the traditional sense but serve as fuel sources. Sorium (fuel) can be harvested from gas giant atmospheres using fuel harvester ships.
- **Gas Giant Moons**: Moons of gas giants are often terrestrial bodies in their own right and can be excellent colonization targets. Large gas giants may have many moons.
- **Dwarf Planets**: Smaller bodies (Pluto-like) with minimal atmospheres. Useful for mining but rarely suitable for large colonies.
- **Asteroids**: Small rocky bodies, usually found in belts. They can contain minerals and can be mined but do not support populations.
- **Comets**: Icy bodies in distant orbits. Rarely significant strategically.

**Planetary Properties**:

Each terrestrial body has detailed properties:
- **Radius and Gravity**: Affects habitability and infrastructure requirements
- **Orbital Distance**: Determines base temperature from stellar heating
- **Atmospheric Composition**: The specific gases present and their concentrations (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, chlorine, etc.)
- **Atmospheric Pressure**: From vacuum to crushing super-dense atmospheres
- **Surface Temperature**: The effective surface temperature considering atmosphere and distance
- **Hydrosphere**: Percentage of surface covered by liquid (water, other liquids)
- **Tectonic Activity**: Affects colony infrastructure and mineral accessibility
- **Magnetic Field**: Affects radiation shielding and habitability

**Habitability Assessment**: Aurora calculates a Colony Cost for each body, representing how expensive it is to maintain colonists there. A Colony Cost of 0 means the world is naturally habitable (matching your species' requirements perfectly). Higher values mean infrastructure (environmental protection, heating/cooling) is required, costing resources per unit of population.

**Terraforming Potential**: Most planets can be modified over time through terraforming:
- Adding or removing atmospheric gases
- Adjusting greenhouse effect (temperature modification)
- Terraforming is slow (decades to centuries) and requires dedicated installations
- Some worlds are more practical terraform targets than others — thin atmospheres are easier to modify than crushing ones

## 2.3.3 Mineral Distribution

Minerals are Aurora's fundamental economic resource. Every construction project, ship component, and installation requires specific minerals in specific quantities. Their distribution across orbital bodies drives expansion and strategic decisions.

**Mineral Types**: Aurora uses eleven minerals, each required for different purposes:

| Mineral | Primary Uses |
|---------|-------------|
| Duranium | Armor, structural components, basic construction |
| Neutronium | Armor (advanced), heavy structural elements |
| Corbomite | Armor (advanced types), specialized shielding |
| Tritanium | Engines, reactor components |
| Boronide | Engines, power systems |
| Mercassium | Electronics, sensors, fire control |
| Vendarite | Electronics, communication systems |
| Sorium | Fuel (refined into fuel), fuel-related components |
| Uridium | Weapons, beam weapon components |
| Corundium | Weapons, missile components |
| Gallicite | Engines (critical), jump drive components |

**Mineral Deposits**: Each orbital body can have deposits of any or all minerals. A deposit is defined by two values:
- **Quantity**: How many tons of the mineral are present (can range from hundreds to millions)
- **Accessibility**: A value from 0.1 to 1.0 representing how easy the mineral is to extract. Higher accessibility means faster extraction rates. Accessibility decreases as a deposit is mined, eventually reaching very low values where mining becomes inefficient.

**Distribution Patterns**:
- Larger bodies tend to have more mineral deposits overall
- Asteroids often have high accessibility but low total quantity
- Gas giants cannot be mined but their moons often have good deposits
- Mineral distribution is randomized but weighted by body type and size
- The game's mineral availability setting (from game creation) affects overall abundance

**Geological Survey**: Minerals are not visible until a body has been surveyed by a ship with geological survey sensors. Conducting surveys is a critical early-game activity — you cannot plan colonization without knowing where resources are.

**Strategic Implications**:
- **Gallicite** is often the bottleneck mineral — required for engines and in limited supply. Prioritize surveying and mining Gallicite deposits.
- **Duranium** is needed in large quantities for almost everything. Fortunately, it tends to be more common.
- **Sorium** for fuel can be mined from deposits or harvested from gas giants. Gas giant harvesting is renewable; mineral deposits deplete over time.
- Finding a body with high-accessibility deposits of multiple critical minerals is a major strategic windfall — these locations often become major mining colonies.
- Poor mineral distribution in your home system is not necessarily a problem — it motivates expansion and creates interesting logistical challenges.

**Mining Operations**: Minerals are extracted by mining installations (on colonies) or automated mining ships (which can operate without a permanent colony). The extraction rate depends on:
- Number of mining installations or mining ship capacity
- Accessibility of the deposit
- Governor bonuses (if applicable)
- Overall, deposits deplete over time and eventually become uneconomical to mine
