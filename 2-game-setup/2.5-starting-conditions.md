# 2.5 Starting Conditions

*Added: v2026.01.23*

## 2.5.1 Conventional Start

A Conventional Start begins your civilization at roughly early 21st century technology. You have no Trans-Newtonian elements, no advanced propulsion, and no capability to build practical spacecraft. This is the slower, more immersive option.

**What You Begin With:**

- **Earth (or equivalent homeworld)**: A populated world with conventional industry
- **Conventional Industry**: Factories, mines, and research labs that operate at reduced efficiency compared to TN equivalents
- **Scientists and Administrators**: A pool of commanders ready to be assigned to research and governance
- **No Ships**: You cannot build spacecraft until TN technology is researched
- **Basic Research**: Access to the research system, with TN-enabling technologies available as research targets

**Early Game Priorities (Conventional Start):** *(v2.6.0)*

The conventional start requires methodical progression through several phases: researching Trans-Newtonian Technology first, building TN industry (mines, factories, labs), constructing your first shipyard, designing survey vessels, and establishing fuel production before Sorium runs out. A year-by-year worked example covering the first 10 years of a conventional start is available in [Section E.3 Early Game Economic Bootstrap](../examples/early-game-economy.md).

> **Warning -- Sorium Depletion:** Earth's Sorium deposits are finite and will eventually run out. In a conventional start, you rely on ground-based refineries consuming Sorium to produce fuel. If you exhaust your Sorium before establishing fuel harvesting from a gas giant, your fleet becomes stranded. Monitor Sorium reserves on the Minerals tab and begin building fuel harvester ships as soon as your shipyard is operational. This is not optional -- it is a race condition that catches many players off guard.

**Timeline**: Expect 20-50 in-game years from game start to having a functional space fleet *(community estimate)*. The exact duration depends on research allocation and luck with scientist skills.

**Why Choose Conventional Start:**

- You experience the full arc from pre-space to interstellar
- Forces deep engagement with the research system
- Creates natural pacing — combat encounters are far in the future
- Provides ample time to learn the interface and mechanics
- Strongest narrative of technological progress

**Recommended Adjustments for Conventional Start:**

When using a conventional start with reduced research speed (e.g., 50%), consider increasing your starting installations to compensate for the slower early game:

- **Research Facilities**: Increase from the default to compensate. The default start includes approximately 40 research facilities \hyperlink{ref-2.5-2}{[2]}. You can adjust this directly on the race creation screen (see [Section 2.2.6 Starting Installations](2.2-race-creation.md)).
- **Conventional Industry**: Consider increasing above the default allocation. Additional conventional factories provide early flexibility and help prevent running out of money during the bootstrapping phase when you have no other income sources.

> **Tip:** These adjustments are particularly helpful for new players who want the learning benefits of a conventional start without an excessively slow early game. The numbers above assume a 50% research speed modifier -- adjust proportionally for other values.

## 2.5.2 Trans-Newtonian Start

A Trans-Newtonian Start begins your civilization already in the space age. Basic spacefaring technology is researched, industry is established, and you can immediately begin designing ships and expanding into space.

**What You Begin With:**

- **Homeworld with TN Industry**: Mines, factories, research labs, fuel refineries, and a shipyard already operational
- **Basic Fleet**: Typically includes at least a gravitational survey ship and possibly a geological survey ship
- **Existing Technology**: Basic engines, sensors, armor, weapons, and all supporting systems
- **Commander Pool**: Officers, scientists, and administrators ready for assignment
- **Established Economy**: Your homeworld is already producing TN materials and can begin ship construction immediately
- **Fuel Reserves**: A starting stockpile of refined fuel for your initial ships

**Starting Assets (TN Start, Default Settings):**

The following values are from a default TN start \hyperlink{ref-2.5-2}{[2]}. Starting installations can be customized directly on the race creation screen (see [Section 2.2.6 Starting Installations](2.2-race-creation.md)).

| Installation | Starting Count |
|-------------|---------------|
| Population | 1,000 million (1 billion) |
| Construction Factories | 800 |
| Mines | 800 |
| Ordnance Factories | 200 |
| Fuel Refineries | 200 |
| Financial Centres | 400 |
| Maintenance Facilities | 300 |
| Automated Mines | 160 |
| Fighter Factories | 80 |
| Research Facilities | 40 |
| Ground Force Construction Complexes | 8 |
| Deep Space Tracking Stations | 7 |
| Military Academies | 2 |
| Infrastructure | 200 |
| Fuel Stockpile | 24,000,000 litres |
| Maintenance Stockpile (MSP) | 60,000 |

\hyperlink{ref-2.5-2}{[2]}

> **Note:** Starting population was increased from 500 million to one billion as of v2.1.1 \hyperlink{ref-2.5-1}{[1]}.

**Early Game Priorities (TN Start):**

1. **Survey Your Home System**: Use your gravitational survey ship to find jump points. Use geological survey ships to identify mineral deposits on planets and moons.
2. **Assess Minerals**: Check your homeworld's mineral reserves. If any critical minerals are low (especially Gallicite), finding alternative sources is urgent.
3. **Begin Research**: Assign scientists to key technologies. Early priorities:
   - Better engines (faster ships, more fuel efficient)
   - Construction technology (faster building)
   - Sensors (detect threats earlier)
   - Shields or armor improvements (survivability)
4. **Expand Industry**: Queue additional mines and factories on your homeworld. More industry means faster growth.
5. **Design Ships**: Create designs for the ships you need (see [Section 8.1 Design Philosophy](../8-ship-design/8.1-design-philosophy.md)) — additional survey vessels, fuel harvesters, freighters, and eventually warships.
6. **Establish Fuel Harvesting**: If there is a gas giant in your system, design and deploy fuel harvester ships to ensure long-term fuel supply.
7. **Explore through jump points**: Once jump points are located (see [Section 10.2 Jump Transit](../10-navigation/10.2-jump-transit.md)), send ships through to survey new systems. This reveals new colonization targets and potential threats.

**Timeline**: You can be exploring neighboring star systems within 5-10 in-game years *(community estimate)*. A meaningful military fleet can be operational within 15-25 years depending on priorities *(community estimate)*.

## 2.5.3 Sol vs Random System

Your starting star system choice determines the geography of your early game and influences expansion patterns.

**Starting in Sol:**

Sol is the real solar system -- the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and their moons, with mineral deposits and conditions pre-defined. When "Real Stars" is selected in game creation, Sol's layout reproduces the actual solar system bodies with fixed mineral deposits and orbital parameters \hyperlink{ref-2.5-3}{[3]}.

**Advantages of Sol:**

- **Familiarity**: You know the layout. Mars, the Moon, and the gas giants are where you expect them. Distances and travel times feel intuitive.
- **Known Geography**: Jupiter and Saturn are guaranteed fuel harvesting locations. Mars and the Moon are known nearby colonization targets.
- **Tutorial Compatibility**: Most guides and tutorials assume a Sol start, making them easier to follow.
- **Real Stellar Neighborhood**: If using real star data, nearby systems are actual stars (Alpha Centauri, Barnard's Star, etc.) at correct relative distances \hyperlink{ref-2.5-3}{[3]}.

**Disadvantages of Sol:**

- **Fixed Mineral Distribution**: Sol's mineral deposits are pre-set and may not be optimal \hyperlink{ref-2.5-3}{[3]}. Earth's minerals are finite and will eventually deplete.
- **Predictable**: If you have played Sol starts before, the early game exploration is less exciting.
- **Distance to Gas Giants**: Jupiter is quite far from Earth — early fuel harvesting requires significant travel time.

**Starting in a Random System:**

A random system is procedurally generated — the star type, number of planets, orbital distances, mineral deposits, and conditions are all randomized.

**Advantages of Random Start:**

- **Unique Every Game**: Each playthrough presents new challenges and opportunities. Your first survey reveals an unknown system.
- **Potentially Better Resources**: Random generation might give you rich mineral deposits close to your homeworld, or a gas giant in a convenient orbit.
- **Discovery Factor**: Everything is unknown — even your home system requires exploration.
- **Replayability**: No two random starts are alike.

**Disadvantages of Random Start:**

- **Potentially Harsh**: Random generation might give you poor minerals, no nearby gas giants, or unfavorable system geometry.
- **No Reference Frame**: New players lose the intuitive distance sense that Sol provides.
- **Tutorial Disconnect**: Guides referencing specific Sol features will not apply.

**Recommendation:**

- First game: Use Sol. The familiarity helps while learning.
- Subsequent games: Random systems provide variety and fresh challenges.
- Experienced players: Random is generally preferred for the unpredictability and unique strategic puzzles each game presents.

**Hybrid Approach**: Some players start in Sol with real star data, giving familiar geography locally but unknown systems beyond. This combines the advantages of both approaches — a known starting position with an unexplored galaxy beyond.
