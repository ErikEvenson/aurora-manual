# 2.4 Starting Conditions

## 2.4.1 Conventional Start

A Conventional Start begins your civilization at roughly early 21st century technology. You have no Trans-Newtonian elements, no advanced propulsion, and no capability to build practical spacecraft. This is the slower, more immersive option.

**What You Begin With:**

- **Earth (or equivalent homeworld)**: A populated world with conventional industry
- **Conventional Industry**: Factories, mines, and research labs that operate at reduced efficiency compared to TN equivalents
- **Scientists and Administrators**: A pool of commanders ready to be assigned to research and governance
- **No Ships**: You cannot build spacecraft until TN technology is researched
- **Basic Research**: Access to the research system, with TN-enabling technologies available as research targets

**Early Game Priorities (Conventional Start):**

1. **Research Trans-Newtonian Technology**: This is the foundational technology that unlocks everything else. Assign your best scientists to it immediately.
2. **Develop TN Industry**: Once TN tech is discovered, you can begin converting conventional industry to TN equivalents (or building new TN installations). TN mines produce more, TN factories build faster.
3. **Research Basic Space Technology**: After TN basics, you need propulsion, life support, and construction technologies before you can design ships.
4. **Build Your First Shipyard**: A shipyard is required to construct spacecraft (see [Section 6.3 Construction](../6-economy-and-industry/6.3-construction.md)). This is a major investment in the early game.
5. **Design and Build Survey Ships**: Your first ships should be gravitational survey vessels to find jump points, and geological survey ships to identify mineral deposits in your home system.

**Timeline**: Expect 20-50 in-game years from game start to having a functional space fleet. The exact duration depends on research allocation and luck with scientist skills.

**Why Choose Conventional Start:**

- You experience the full arc from pre-space to interstellar
- Forces deep engagement with the research system
- Creates natural pacing — combat encounters are far in the future
- Provides ample time to learn the interface and mechanics
- Strongest narrative of technological progress

## 2.4.2 Trans-Newtonian Start

A Trans-Newtonian Start begins your civilization already in the space age. Basic spacefaring technology is researched, industry is established, and you can immediately begin designing ships and expanding into space.

**What You Begin With:**

- **Homeworld with TN Industry**: Mines, factories, research labs, fuel refineries, and a shipyard already operational
- **Basic Fleet**: Typically includes at least a gravitational survey ship and possibly a geological survey ship
- **Existing Technology**: Basic engines, sensors, armor, weapons, and all supporting systems
- **Commander Pool**: Officers, scientists, and administrators ready for assignment
- **Established Economy**: Your homeworld is already producing TN materials and can begin ship construction immediately
- **Fuel Reserves**: A starting stockpile of refined fuel for your initial ships

**Starting Assets (Typical TN Start):**

- 1-2 Shipyards (capable of building ships up to a certain tonnage)
- Several hundred Construction Factories
- Several hundred Mines
- Research Labs
- Fuel Refineries
- A small maintenance facility
- Ground Forces (basic garrison units)
- One billion population on the homeworld (increased from 500 million as of v2.1.1)

**Early Game Priorities (TN Start):**

1. **Survey Your Home System**: Use your gravitational survey ship to find jump points. Use geological survey ships to identify mineral deposits on planets and moons.
2. **Assess Minerals**: Check your homeworld's mineral reserves. If any critical minerals are low (especially Gallicite), finding alternative sources is urgent.
3. **Begin Research**: Assign scientists to key technologies. Early priorities:
   - Better engines (faster ships, more fuel efficient)
   - Construction technology (faster building)
   - Sensors (detect threats earlier)
   - Shields or armor improvements (survivability)
4. **Expand Industry**: Queue additional mines and factories on your homeworld. More industry means faster growth.
5. **Design Ships**: Create designs for the ships you need (see [Section 8.1 Design Philosophy](../8-ship-design/8.1-design-philosophy.md)) — additional survey vessels, fuel harvesters, freighters, and eventually warships.
6. **Establish Fuel Harvesting**: If there is a gas giant in your system, design and deploy fuel harvester ships to ensure long-term fuel supply.
7. **Explore Through Jump Points**: Once jump points are located (see [Section 10.2 Jump Transit](../10-navigation/10.2-jump-transit.md)), send ships through to survey new systems. This reveals new colonization targets and potential threats.

**Timeline**: You can be exploring neighboring star systems within 5-10 in-game years. A meaningful military fleet can be operational within 15-25 years depending on priorities.

## 2.4.3 Sol vs Random System

Your starting star system choice determines the geography of your early game and influences expansion patterns.

**Starting in Sol:**

Sol is the real solar system — the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and their moons, with mineral deposits and conditions pre-defined.

**Advantages of Sol:**

- **Familiarity**: You know the layout. Mars, the Moon, and the gas giants are where you expect them. Distances and travel times feel intuitive.
- **Known Geography**: Jupiter and Saturn are guaranteed fuel harvesting locations. Mars and the Moon are known nearby colonization targets.
- **Tutorial Compatibility**: Most guides and tutorials assume a Sol start, making them easier to follow.
- **Real Stellar Neighborhood**: If using real star data, nearby systems are actual stars (Alpha Centauri, Barnard's Star, etc.) at correct relative distances.

**Disadvantages of Sol:**

- **Fixed Mineral Distribution**: Sol's mineral deposits are pre-set and may not be optimal. Earth's minerals are finite and will eventually deplete.
- **Predictable**: If you have played Sol starts before, the early game exploration is less exciting.
- **Distance to Gas Giants**: Jupiter is quite far from Earth — early fuel harvesting requires significant travel time.

**Starting in a Random System:**

A random system is procedurally generated — the star type, number of planets, orbital distances, mineral deposits, and conditions are all randomized.

**Advantages of Random Start:**

- **Unique Every Game**: Each playthrough presents new challenges and opportunities. Your first survey reveals an unknown system.
- **Potentially Better Resources**: Random generation might give you rich mineral deposits close to your homeworld, or a gas giant in a convenient orbit.
- **Discovery Factor**: Everything is unknown — even your home system requires exploration.
- **Replayability**: No two random starts are alike.

**Disadvantages of Random Start:**

- **Potentially Harsh**: Random generation might give you poor minerals, no nearby gas giants, or unfavorable system geometry.
- **No Reference Frame**: New players lose the intuitive distance sense that Sol provides.
- **Tutorial Disconnect**: Guides referencing specific Sol features will not apply.

**Recommendation:**

- First game: Use Sol. The familiarity helps while learning.
- Subsequent games: Random systems provide variety and fresh challenges.
- Experienced players: Random is generally preferred for the unpredictability and unique strategic puzzles each game presents.

**Hybrid Approach**: Some players start in Sol with real star data, giving familiar geography locally but unknown systems beyond. This combines the advantages of both approaches — a known starting position with an unexplored galaxy beyond.
