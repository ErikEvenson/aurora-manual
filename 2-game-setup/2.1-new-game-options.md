# 2.1 New Game Options

## 2.1.1 Game Name and Settings

When creating a new game in Aurora C#, you begin with the game creation window, which presents several foundational options that shape your entire playthrough.

**Game Name**: A descriptive label for your game. This is primarily for your own reference when managing multiple games in the same database. Choose something meaningful — you may have this game running for months of real time.

**Start Year**: The calendar year the game begins. The default is typically 2025 or similar near-future date. This is purely cosmetic and affects nothing mechanically, but it does set the tone for your narrative. Some players use far-future dates for more science-fiction oriented games, or historical dates for alternate-history scenarios.

**Difficulty Modifiers**: Aurora provides several options that adjust the overall difficulty:

- **NPR Generation Strength**: Controls how powerful computer-controlled races are when generated. Higher values give NPRs more starting colonies, ships, and technology — making first contact more dangerous.
- **Mineral Availability**: Adjusts the overall abundance of minerals across all generated bodies. Lower values create resource scarcity, forcing expansion; higher values allow more comfortable development.
- **Research Speed Modifier**: A multiplier affecting how quickly research projects complete. Reducing this makes technology advancement slower and more considered; increasing it accelerates the pace of the game.

**Number of Starting Systems**: Controls how many star systems are generated at game start. Additional systems are generated as jump points are transited, but having more starting systems means NPRs have more room to develop before you encounter them.

## 2.1.2 NPR Options

Non-Player Races (NPRs) are Aurora's AI-controlled civilizations. Their configuration at game start significantly affects your experience.

**NPR Generation**: You can control whether NPRs are generated at game start, or whether new NPRs can appear during the game:

- **Generate NPRs at Start**: Creates AI races in the galaxy from the beginning. They will develop independently, researching technology, building fleets, and expanding. You may encounter them as hostile empires, potential allies, or anything in between.
- **Allow New NPR Generation**: If enabled, new races can spawn during the game in unexplored systems. This prevents the galaxy from feeling "empty" even after you have explored most known systems.
- **NPR Count**: The number of NPRs to generate at start. More NPRs create a more competitive galaxy but also increase processing time per turn.

**NPR Behavior Settings**:
- **Aggressiveness**: Influences how likely NPRs are to initiate hostilities. This does not guarantee peace or war — it adjusts probabilities in their diplomatic AI.
- **Expansion Rate**: How aggressively NPRs colonize new worlds and push outward. Faster expansion means you are more likely to encounter them sooner.

**SpaceMaster NPR Management**: Even after game creation, you can use SpaceMaster mode to manually create, edit, or delete NPRs. This is useful for setting up specific scenarios or adding narrative elements to your game.

**Practical Tips:**
- For a first game, consider starting with 1-2 NPRs or none at all. This lets you learn mechanics without the pressure of an arms race.
- NPRs with a head start (high generation strength) can be shockingly powerful when encountered. A first-contact war against a well-developed NPR is a common cause of early game-overs.
- NPR processing adds the most time to turn advancement. If your turns are taking too long, the number and complexity of NPRs is usually the culprit.

## 2.1.3 Advanced Settings

Beyond the core options, Aurora provides several advanced settings that experienced players use to customize their experience.

**Real Stars vs. Procedural Generation**:
- **Real Star Data**: Aurora can generate a galaxy based on real stellar data from our neighborhood. Stars within a configurable radius of Sol are placed at their actual relative positions with accurate spectral types. This creates a familiar galaxy for players who want to explore real star systems.
- **Procedural Stars**: Alternatively, star systems are generated procedurally with randomized positions, types, and jump point connections. This provides a unique galaxy each game.
- **Hybrid**: You can use real star data for the core and procedural generation beyond it.

**Jump Point Configuration**:
- **Jump Point Distance**: Controls how far from the primary star jump points generate. Affects travel time within systems.
- **Jump Point Connection Probability**: Influences how densely systems are connected. More connections create a web-like topology; fewer create chokepoints and strategic corridors.

**Game Speed and Processing**:
- **Interrupt Settings**: Configure which events cause the time advance to pause (e.g., hostile contacts, completed research, ship arrivals). Fine-tuning these prevents important events from being missed during long time advances.
- **Simultaneous Research**: Whether scientists working in the same field provide diminishing returns or full contribution. Affects how you structure your research program.

**Fuel and Maintenance**:
- **Fuel Consumption Modifier**: Adjusts how much fuel ships consume. Higher values make fuel logistics more challenging and fuel harvesting more critical.
- **Maintenance Modifier**: Adjusts failure rates for ship components. Higher values punish poorly-maintained fleets and make maintenance facilities more important.

**Other Toggles**:
- **Precursor Ruins**: Whether ancient alien ruins can appear on planets. These provide research bonuses and recovered technology, adding an exploration incentive.
- **Spoiler Races**: Pre-designed hostile entities that can appear in the galaxy (similar to Dwarf Fortress "fun"). These create dangerous encounters in otherwise empty space.
