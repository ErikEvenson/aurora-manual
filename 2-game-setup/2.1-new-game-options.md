# 2.1 New Game Options

## 2.1.1 Game Name and Settings

When creating a new game in Aurora C#, you begin with the game creation window, which presents several foundational options that shape your entire playthrough.

**Game Name**: A descriptive label for your game. This is primarily for your own reference when managing multiple games in the same database. Choose something meaningful — you may have this game running for months of real time.

**Start Year**: The calendar year the game begins. The default is typically 2025 or similar near-future date. This is purely cosmetic and affects nothing mechanically, but it does set the tone for your narrative. Some players use far-future dates for more science-fiction oriented games, or historical dates for alternate-history scenarios.

**Difficulty Modifiers**: Aurora provides several options that adjust the overall difficulty:

- **NPR Generation Strength**: Controls how powerful computer-controlled races are when generated. Higher values give NPRs more starting colonies, ships, and technology -- making first contact more dangerous.
- **Mineral Availability**: Adjusts the overall abundance of minerals across all generated bodies. Lower values create resource scarcity, forcing expansion; higher values allow more comfortable development. This is a percentage modifier specific to the Sol System's starting minerals.
- **Research Speed Modifier**: A percentage multiplier affecting how quickly research projects complete for all player races. Reducing this makes technology advancement slower and more considered; increasing it accelerates the pace of the game.
- **Terraforming Speed Modifier**: A percentage multiplier for terraforming speed affecting all factions.
- **Survey Speed Modifier**: Adjusts survey point generation rate for survey ships. A value of 100 is standard; 50 makes surveys take twice as long; 125 makes them 25% faster. Only affects survey point production, not other survey mechanics.

**Number of Starting Systems**: Controls how many star systems are generated at game start. Additional systems are generated as jump points are transited, but having more starting systems means NPRs have more room to develop before you encounter them.

## 2.1.2 NPR Options

Non-Player Races (NPRs) are Aurora's AI-controlled civilizations. Their configuration at game start significantly affects your experience.

**NPR Generation**: You can control whether NPRs are generated at game start, or whether new NPRs can appear during the game:

- **Generate NPRs at Start**: Creates AI races in the galaxy from the beginning. They will develop independently, researching technology, building fleets, and expanding. You may encounter them as hostile empires, potential allies, or anything in between.
- **Allow New NPR Generation**: If enabled, new races can spawn during the game in unexplored systems. This prevents the galaxy from feeling "empty" even after you have explored most known systems.
- **NPR Count**: The number of NPRs to generate at start. More NPRs create a more competitive galaxy but also increase processing time per turn.

**NPR Behavior Settings**:
- **Aggressiveness**: Influences how likely NPRs are to initiate hostilities. This does not guarantee peace or war — it adjusts probabilities in their diplomatic AI.
- **Expansion Rate**: How aggressively NPRs colonize new worlds and push outward. Faster expansion means you are more likely to encounter them sooner.

**SpaceMaster NPR Management**: Even after game creation, you can use SpaceMaster mode to manually create, edit, or delete NPRs. This is useful for setting up specific scenarios or adding narrative elements to your game.

**Practical Tips:**
- For a first game, consider starting with 1-2 NPRs or none at all. This lets you learn mechanics without the pressure of an arms race.
- NPRs with a head start (high generation strength) can be shockingly powerful when encountered. A first-contact war against a well-developed NPR is a common cause of early game-overs.
- NPR processing adds the most time to turn advancement. If your turns are taking too long, the number and complexity of NPRs is usually the culprit.

## 2.1.3 Advanced Settings

Beyond the core options, Aurora provides several advanced settings that experienced players use to customize their experience.

**Real Stars vs. Procedural Generation**:
- **Real Star Data**: Aurora can generate a galaxy based on real stellar data from our neighborhood. Stars within a configurable radius of Sol are placed at their actual relative positions with accurate spectral types. This creates a familiar galaxy for players who want to explore real star systems.
- **Procedural Stars**: Alternatively, star systems are generated procedurally with randomized positions, types, and jump point connections. This provides a unique galaxy each game.
- **Hybrid**: You can use real star data for the core and procedural generation beyond it.

**Jump Point Configuration**:
- **Jump Point Distance**: Controls how far from the primary star jump points generate. Affects travel time within systems.
- **Jump Point Connection Probability**: Influences how densely systems are connected. More connections create a web-like topology; fewer create chokepoints and strategic corridors.

**Game Speed and Processing**:
- **Interrupt Settings**: Configure which events cause the time advance to pause (e.g., hostile contacts, completed research, ship arrivals). Fine-tuning these prevents important events from being missed during long time advances.
- **Simultaneous Research**: Whether scientists working in the same field provide diminishing returns or full contribution. Affects how you structure your research program.

**Fuel and Maintenance**:
- **Fuel Consumption Modifier**: Adjusts how much fuel ships consume. Higher values make fuel logistics more challenging and fuel harvesting more critical.
- **Maintenance Modifier**: Adjusts failure rates for ship components. Higher values punish poorly-maintained fleets and make maintenance facilities more important.

**Civilian Operations**:
- **Civilian Shipping Lines**: Toggle whether NPC merchant fleets are constructed and operate. When disabled, no civilian shipping lines will form, requiring the player to handle all cargo transport.
- **Civilian Harvesters**: Toggle whether civilian fuel harvesters are automatically deployed. When disabled, prevents automatic fuel harvester deployment by civilian entities.

**Technology and Conquest**:
- **Technology Recovery from Conquest**: Toggle whether technology can be acquired from conquered civilizations. When disabled, prevents tech acquisition through military conquest, limiting technology gains to research and ruin exploitation.

**Solar System Options**:
- **Planet X**: Optional inclusion of the hypothetical Planet X in Sol System scenarios, adding an additional outer system body.
- **Ruins Chance**: The default probability of ruins appearing on qualifying bodies is 20%. This value can be adjusted through the game settings window. Qualifying bodies must be terrestrial worlds, terrestrial moons, or small terrestrial moons with gravity greater than 0.4G and temperatures between 200K and 360K.

**Starting Location**:
- **NPR Distance from Sol**: A light-year entry field that restricts non-player race starting positions to within the specified distance from Sol. Useful for ensuring early contact or creating buffer zones.

**Race Configuration**:
- **Multiple Player Races**: Multiple Earth-based player races can be selected during game setup. Each requires a separate race creation process through the race creation window.

**Starting Build Points**: Players can allocate starting build points (equivalent to two years of wealth) for immediate ship and ground formation construction at game start. Build point allocation is available through both the Class Design window and the Economics interface.

**Spoiler Race Settings**:
- **Precursor Ruins**: Whether ancient alien ruins can appear on planets. These provide research bonuses and recovered technology, adding an exploration incentive.
- **Spoiler Races**: Pre-designed hostile entities that can appear in the galaxy. Individual types (Swarm, Raiders, Invaders, Rakhas) can be toggled independently.
- **System Discovery Thresholds**: Configure how many star systems must be discovered before each spoiler faction's start time is triggered (see Section 18.3.7 for details on the start time system).
