# 2.1 New Game Options

*Added: v2026.01.23*

When creating a new game in Aurora C#, you begin with the Game Information window, which presents settings organized into three columns. This section documents each setting in the order it appears on screen from top to bottom within each column.

## 2.1.1 Left Column Settings

Settings appear in this order from top to bottom:

- **Game Name**: A descriptive label for your game. This is primarily for your own reference when managing multiple games in the same database. Choose something meaningful — you may have this game running for months of real time.

- **Maximum Number of Systems**: Limits the total number of star systems that can exist in the game. The default is approximately 1000 systems. Once this limit is reached, jump point transits will no longer generate new systems. Lower values create a smaller, more constrained galaxy; higher values allow for larger-scale games but increase database size and processing requirements.

- **Local System Generation Chance %**: The probability that a newly generated system will be connected to nearby existing systems rather than appearing in isolation. Higher values create denser clusters of interconnected systems; lower values spread systems more evenly across the galaxy.

- **Local System Generation Spread**: Controls how far from existing systems new systems can be generated when local generation triggers. Higher spread values create looser clusters with more distance between systems; lower values create tighter groupings.

- **Construction Cycle Time** *(v2.7.1)*: Controls the frequency at which production activities are processed, measured in seconds. The default is 5 days (432,000 seconds). This determines how often mining, construction, shipbuilding, and other economic activities are calculated and updated. Shorter cycles provide smoother, more granular production output but increase processing time per turn increment. Longer cycles reduce processing overhead but result in lumpier production where output arrives in larger, less frequent batches. For most games the default is appropriate, but players running very large empires may increase this value to reduce turn processing time.

- **Difficulty Modifier (100 = Normal)**: A global difficulty scaling factor affecting various game mechanics. Values above 100 increase challenge; values below 100 reduce it. This modifier influences multiple systems including combat calculations and AI behavior. *(Needs verification: exact mechanics affected)*

- **Research Speed (100 = Normal)**: A percentage multiplier affecting how quickly research projects complete (see [Section 7.1 Technology Tree](../7-research/7.1-technology-tree.md)) for all player races. Reducing this makes technology advancement slower and more considered; increasing it accelerates the pace of the game.

- **Terraforming Speed (100 = Normal)**: A percentage multiplier for terraforming speed affecting all factions.

- **Survey Speed**: Adjusts survey point generation rate for survey ships. A value of 100 is standard; 50 makes surveys take twice as long; 125 makes them 25% faster. Only affects survey point production, not other survey mechanics.

- **Ruin Generation Chance**: The default probability of ruins appearing on qualifying bodies is 20%. Qualifying bodies must be terrestrial worlds, terrestrial moons, or small terrestrial moons with gravity greater than 0.4G and temperatures between 200K and 360K.

- **Minimum Comets per System**: Sets the minimum number of comets generated in each star system. Comets can provide harvestable resources, particularly for fuel production. Higher values ensure more comet availability but may increase system complexity.

- **Truce Countdown**: Sets the duration of truces in game time. When factions agree to a truce, this value determines how long the truce lasts before diplomatic relations can shift again. Longer truce durations provide more stability but reduce diplomatic flexibility.

- **Spacemaster Password**: Sets a password required to access SpaceMaster mode. SpaceMaster mode allows direct editing of game data, spawning entities, and other administrative functions. Setting a password prevents accidental access.

- **Combat Password**: Sets a password for accessing combat-related SpaceMaster functions. This provides an additional layer of protection for combat-specific administrative actions. *(Needs verification: exact functions protected)*

- **Displayed Race**: Selects which race's perspective is shown in the game interface when multiple player races exist. This controls which race's ships, colonies, and information are displayed by default.

- **Sol Citizens**: The starting population label or identifier for Earth's inhabitants. *(Needs verification: exact purpose and effect)*

> **Tip:** At the default 100% research speed, technology frequently outpaces production capacity. Players often research a new engine generation before they can build ships using the previous one. The community recommends reducing research speed to 50% for better-paced gameplay where production can keep up with discoveries.

> **Tip:** A common community guideline for balancing these modifiers: set terraforming speed and survey speed to no more than your research speed value and no less than half that value. For example, with research speed at 50%, set terraforming and survey speeds between 25% and 50%.

## 2.1.2 Middle Column Settings

### NPR Generation Values

- **NPR Generation Chance (By Player)**: The percentage chance of generating a new NPR when a player-controlled ship transits a jump point into an unexplored system. Higher values create a more populated galaxy through exploration.

- **NPR Generation Chance By NPR%**: The percentage chance of generating a new NPR when an NPR-controlled ship transits a jump point into an unexplored system. This allows the galaxy to become more populated even without player exploration.

- **NPR Base Explored Transits**: The base number of jump points that a newly generated NPR has already explored. This determines how much of the galaxy the NPR has already mapped when they first appear.

- **NPR Random Explored Transits**: Additional random number of explored jump points added to the base value. Combined with the base value, this creates variation in how extensively new NPRs have explored their surroundings.

- **NPR Max Start Systems (0 = Unlimited)**: Limits the maximum number of star systems a newly generated NPR can control at creation. A value of 0 means unlimited -- the NPR's starting territory is determined entirely by other factors.

- **Pre-Industrial NPR %**: Percentage of generated NPRs that are pre-industrial civilizations. These races have not yet developed industrial technology and pose no immediate military threat, though they may advance over time.

- **Industrial NPR %**: Percentage of generated NPRs that are industrial (conventional technology) civilizations. These races have achieved industrial capability but lack Trans-Newtonian technology.

- **Minor Trans-Newtonian NPR %**: Percentage of generated NPRs that are minor Trans-Newtonian powers. These races have discovered TN technology but are less developed than major powers.

- **Healthy Modifier**: A percentage modifier affecting population health calculations. This influences factors such as population growth rates and the overall vitality of colonies. Higher values create healthier populations with improved growth characteristics.

The remaining percentage (100% minus the sum of Pre-Industrial, Industrial, and Minor Trans-Newtonian values) determines the proportion of major Trans-Newtonian NPRs -- fully developed spacefaring civilizations that can pose significant threats.

### Checkboxes

**Game Mechanics:**

- **One Second Sub Pulse**: When enabled, allows time increments as small as one second. This provides fine-grained control for tactical combat situations but significantly increases processing time. Typically used only during intense combat engagements where second-by-second resolution is needed. *(Needs verification: performance impact)*

- **All Jump Points are Stable**: When enabled, all jump points in the game are stable (bidirectional and permanent). Disabling this allows unstable jump points that may be one-way or temporary, adding uncertainty to expansion and requiring jump point stabilization technology. *(Needs verification: exact unstable jump point mechanics)*

- **Eccentric Orbits**: When enabled, planetary orbits can have higher eccentricity values, creating more elliptical orbits. This affects seasonal temperature variations and orbital mechanics. Disabled by default for more circular, stable orbits.

- **Orbital Motion for Planets**: When enabled, planets move along their orbital paths as game time advances. This affects sensor ranges, travel times, and tactical positioning. Disabled by default for simplified gameplay where planets remain stationary. *(Needs verification: performance impact)*

- **Inexperienced Fleets Penalty** *(v2.7.1)*: When enabled, requires fleets to undergo training after commissioning before reaching full effectiveness. New crews start at a lower training grade and must accumulate training time before reaching their full operational capability. This adds a realistic readiness dimension to fleet management -- newly constructed ships cannot immediately perform at peak efficiency.

- **Commander Political Bonuses** *(v2.7.1)*: Adds political value as a factor in the officer promotion formula. When enabled, commanders gain political influence over the course of their careers that affects their advancement prospects. Officers with higher political value receive promotion advantages.

- **Limited Research Administration**: When enabled, limits the number of research projects that can be conducted simultaneously based on available research administrators. This adds a management layer requiring players to prioritize research directions rather than pursuing all paths at once. *(Needs verification: exact administrator mechanics)*

- **New Tech from Conquest**: When enabled, capturing enemy ships or installations can provide research bonuses toward technologies the enemy possesses. This rewards aggressive expansion and creates incentives for capturing rather than destroying enemy assets.

- **No Maintenance Resupply**: When enabled, ships cannot be resupplied with maintenance supplies from colonies or supply ships. This forces players to return ships to shipyards for maintenance, adding logistical complexity to long-range operations. *(Needs verification: exact maintenance mechanics affected)*

**Civilian Operations:**

- **Civilian Shipping Lines**: Toggle whether NPC merchant fleets are constructed and operate. When disabled, no civilian shipping lines will form, requiring the player to handle all cargo transport.

- **Civilian Harvesters**: Toggle whether civilian fuel harvesters are automatically deployed. When disabled, prevents automatic fuel harvester deployment by civilian entities.

- **Civilian Mining Colonies** (v2.7.0): Controls whether civilian mining colonies can be established (default enabled). See [Section 6.5.2 Civilian Mining](../6-economy-and-industry/6.5-civilian-economy.md) for mechanics.

**NPR Options:**

- **Generate New Races as NPRs**: When enabled, new AI races can spawn during the game as jump points are explored. This prevents the galaxy from feeling "empty" even after you have explored most known systems.

- **Allow Human NPRs**: When enabled, newly generated NPRs can be human civilizations rather than alien races. This creates alternate human factions that may have diverged from Earth or represent lost colonies that developed independently.

- **Generate Pre-Industrial Only**: Restricts all generated NPRs to pre-industrial technology level, regardless of the NPR Type Distribution percentages. Useful for scenarios where the player is the only spacefaring civilization.

**Star System Options:**

- **Real Star Data**: Aurora can generate a galaxy based on real stellar data from our neighborhood. As of v2.4.0, the Known Stars database was massively expanded from approximately 4,500 to over 63,000 stars within 775 light years of Sol, sourced from the Hipparcos Catalogue with extensive data cleansing using the Simbad database. Stars are placed at their actual relative positions with accurate spectral types.

- **Use Constellation Names**: When using real star data, enables constellation-based naming for star systems (e.g., "Alpha Centauri" rather than catalog numbers). *(Needs verification: exact behavior)*

- **Use Theme in Known Stars**: When enabled, applies the selected naming theme to known star systems rather than using their real astronomical names. *(Needs verification: interaction with constellation names)*

- **Planet X**: Optional inclusion of the hypothetical Planet X in Sol System scenarios, adding an additional outer system body.

**Spoiler Race Generation:**

- **Generate Precursors**: Enables ancient alien ruins on planets. These provide research bonuses and recovered technology, adding an exploration incentive.

- **Generate Raiders**: Enables the Raiders spoiler faction, hostile pirates that attack shipping and colonies.

- **Generate Invaders**: Enables the Invaders spoiler faction, an aggressive alien species that seeks to conquer inhabited worlds.

- **Generates Rakhas**: Enables the Rakhas spoiler faction, a unique alien threat with distinct behavior patterns. *(Needs verification: Rakhas-specific mechanics)*

- **Generates Aether Raiders**: Enables Aether Raiders, a variant raider faction that operates from Aether Rifts. *(Needs verification: relationship to standard Raiders)*

**Spoiler Race Enhancements:**

- **Enhanced Precursors**: Increases the power and technology level of Precursor ruins and defenses. Creates more challenging archaeological sites with greater rewards.

- **Enhanced Swarm**: Increases the strength and aggression of Star Swarm entities. Makes Swarm encounters more dangerous but potentially more rewarding.

- **Enhanced Raiders**: Increases Raider fleet sizes and technology levels. Creates more formidable pirate threats.

- **Enhanced Invaders**: Increases Invader military capability and expansion rate. Makes the Invader faction a more significant threat.

- **Star Swarm Effects**: Enables environmental and system-wide effects from Star Swarm presence. *(Needs verification: specific effects)*

**NPR Spoiler Generation:**

- **NPRs Generate Precursors**: When enabled, NPR exploration can trigger Precursor discovery events.

- **NPRs Generate Star Swarm**: When enabled, NPR activity can trigger Star Swarm emergence.

- **NPRs Generate Aether Rifts**: When enabled, NPR activity can cause Aether Rift formation.

- **NPRs Generate Invaders**: When enabled, NPR exploration can trigger Invader arrival.

## 2.1.3 Right Column Settings

- **Starting Year**: The calendar year the game begins. The default is typically 2025 or similar near-future date. This is purely cosmetic and affects nothing mechanically, but it does set the tone for your narrative. Some players use far-future dates for more science-fiction oriented games, or historical dates for alternate-history scenarios.

- **Number of Player Races**: The number of player-controlled races at game start. Multiple player races allow for multiplayer games or for single players to manage multiple factions simultaneously.

- **Number of Non-Player Races**: The number of NPRs to generate at start. More NPRs create a more competitive galaxy but also increase processing time per turn.

- **Minimum Sol Jump Points (0 = Random)** *(v2.7.1)*: Specifies the number of jump points generated in the home system at game start. A value of 0 uses the standard random generation. Setting a specific number directly controls how many initial routes exist from your home system, affecting both defensibility and early expansion options. Fewer jump points create more defensible chokepoints but limit expansion directions; more jump points offer greater exploration opportunities but require broader defensive coverage. The community recommends 5-6 jump points for balanced games that provide meaningful strategic choices without overwhelming early-game defense requirements.

- **Earth Mineral Deposits (100 = normal)**: Adjusts the mineral abundance on Earth as a percentage. A value of 100 uses standard deposits; higher values increase starting minerals, lower values create resource scarcity forcing earlier expansion.

- **Minimum NPR Distance (LY)**: A light-year entry field that sets the minimum distance from Sol where non-player races can be generated. Higher values create buffer zones around the player's starting system.

- **Maximum NPR Distance (LY)**: Sets the maximum distance from Sol where non-player races can be generated. Combined with the minimum distance, this creates a band where NPRs can spawn, preventing them from appearing too far away to ever be encountered.

- **Customized NPRs**: The number of NPRs that have been manually customized through the race editor rather than randomly generated. These NPRs retain their custom configurations rather than being regenerated. *(Needs verification: exact customization scope)*

- **Unrest Planet Distance**: Controls how distance from the homeworld affects colony unrest. Colonies farther from the homeworld may experience higher unrest, simulating the challenges of maintaining loyalty across interstellar distances. *(Needs verification: exact formula and thresholds)*

### Spoiler Race Trigger Thresholds

These settings control when spoiler factions become active based on player exploration progress:

- **Player Known Systems for Star Swarm**: Number of star systems the player must discover before Star Swarm activation timer begins.

- **Player Known Systems for Raiders**: Number of star systems the player must discover before Raiders activation timer begins.

- **Player Known Systems for Invaders**: Number of star systems the player must discover before Invaders activation timer begins.

### Minimum Research Point Thresholds

These settings add an additional trigger condition based on total research points accumulated:

- **Minimum Research Points: Precursors**: Research point threshold that must be reached before Precursor-related events can trigger.

- **Minimum Research Points: Raiders**: Research point threshold for Raiders activation.

- **Minimum Research Points: Invaders**: Research point threshold for Invaders activation.

**Practical Tips:**

- For a first game, consider starting with 1-2 NPRs or none at all. This lets you learn mechanics without the pressure of an arms race.
- NPRs with a head start (low Pre-Industrial %, many explored transits) can be shockingly powerful when encountered. A first-contact war against a well-developed NPR is a common cause of early game-overs.
- NPR processing adds the most time to turn advancement. If your turns are taking too long, the number and complexity of NPRs is usually the culprit.
- Even after game creation, you can use SpaceMaster mode to manually create, edit, or delete NPRs. This is useful for setting up specific scenarios or adding narrative elements to your game.

See [Section 18.3 Spoiler Races](../18-advanced-topics/18.3-spoiler-races.md) for detailed mechanics on each spoiler faction.

## 2.1.4 Disaster Scenarios

Aurora provides several disaster scenarios that add existential challenges to the game.

### Earth Death Spiral

The Earth Death Spiral scenario causes Earth to gradually spiral toward the Sun, creating an evacuation deadline for humanity.

**Speed Options:**

| Rate | Approximate Time to Destruction |
|---|---|
| 0.01 AU per year | ~150 years |
| 0.02 AU per year | ~75 years |
| 0.03 AU per year | ~50 years |

**Mechanics:**

- Temperature, year length, and other environmental parameters adjust dynamically as distance to the Sun decreases
- Colony cost increases progressively as conditions deteriorate
- When Earth moves within one million kilometres of the Sun, it is destroyed due to tidal stresses
- Any remaining populations on Earth are also destroyed

This scenario forces players to prioritize interstellar colonization and industrial evacuation over traditional development strategies. See [Section 5.3.5 Earth Death Spiral](../5-colonies/5.3-environment.md#535-earth-death-spiral) for detailed environmental mechanics.

### Solar System Destruction (v2.7.0)

A new apocalyptic disaster option where exotic matter disrupts the sun, causing escalating radiation that forces evacuation.

**Difficulty Variants:**

| Scenario Factor | Difficulty |
|---|---|
| 0.005 | Easy |
| 0.0075 | Medium |
| 0.01 | Hard |

**Radiation Formula:**
```
Annual Radiation = ((Years since start) ^ 3) × (1 / (Body Distance AU ^ 2)) × Scenario Factor
```

**Solar Explosion:** After year 50, the sun has an annual explosion probability of `(Game Years - 50) × 2%`. When the sun explodes, the Sol system is permanently deleted and all jump point connections to Sol are severed.

**Strategic Impact:**

- Inner planets become uninhabitable first (distance-squared scaling)
- Urgent pressure to establish interstellar colonies and relocate infrastructure
- Jump point exploration and colonization become existential priorities
