# 2.2 Race Creation

*Added: v2026.01.23*

## 2.2.1 Race Creation Checkboxes

The Create New Race window includes several checkboxes that control fundamental race behavior:

- **Non-Player Race**: Designates whether the race is controlled by the AI or the player. When enabled, the race becomes an NPR (Non-Player Race) with autonomous AI behavior. When disabled, you control the race directly.

- **Industrial (Low Tech)**: Sets the race to start with pre-industrial or basic conventional technology levels with minimal infrastructure. When disabled, the race starts at higher technology levels based on other game settings.

- **Neutral Race**: Establishes a guaranteed neutral relationship with other races sharing the same starting system for a specified duration. Useful for multi-faction starts without immediate conflict.

- **Auto-Assign Tech Points**: Automatically researches starting technologies based on selected government type rather than requiring manual selection. Recommended for new players.

- **Auto-Design Ground Forces**: Automatically generates starting ground unit designs and templates. When disabled, you must manually design all ground force units.

- **Auto-Design Ship Classes**: Automatically generates starting ship class designs. When disabled, you must manually design all ship classes from scratch.

- **Home System Geo Surveyed**: When enabled, your home system starts with geological surveys complete, revealing all mineral deposits. When disabled, you must survey your own home system.

- **Home System Grav Surveyed**: When enabled, your home system starts with gravitational surveys complete, revealing all jump points. When disabled, you must discover jump points in your own system.

## 2.2.2 Species Attributes

Your species' biological attributes determine which worlds are habitable without environmental modification and what conditions your colonists can tolerate. These choices are permanent and shape your entire colonization strategy.

**Gravity Tolerance**:

- **Homeworld Gravity**: Sets the gravity of your homeworld (Earth = 1.0). Your species is most comfortable at this gravity.
- **Gravity Range**: Defines the minimum and maximum gravity your species can tolerate without infrastructure penalties. Colonies outside this range suffer significant productivity reductions.
- Practical range: Most players use 0.1 to 3.0 as the comfortable band. Narrow gravity tolerance makes fewer worlds habitable but gives more creation points for other attributes.

**Temperature**:

- **Ideal Temperature**: The surface temperature your species prefers (Earth = approximately 14C / 57F).
- **Temperature Range**: The variance from ideal that your species can tolerate. Worlds outside this range require environmental suits or infrastructure modifications.
- Temperature is one of the most restrictive colonization factors — many otherwise suitable worlds have extreme temperatures.

**Atmospheric Requirements**:
Your species requires specific atmospheric conditions:

- **Base Atmosphere**: The gas your species breathes (oxygen for humans). Worlds lacking this gas require sealed habitats or terraforming.
- **Atmospheric Pressure**: Minimum and maximum tolerable pressure. Too thin or too thick and your colonists cannot survive unprotected.
- **Dangerous Gases**: Gases that are toxic to your species (for humans, this includes things like chlorine). Even small concentrations of dangerous gases render a world uninhabitable without protection.
- **Oxygen/Nitrogen Balance**: The specific mix of breathable gases your species requires.

**Practical Impact**: These biological settings determine what percentage of generated worlds are immediately habitable. Earth-standard settings (the default) typically yield few naturally habitable worlds, encouraging terraforming (see [Section 5.5 Terraforming](../5-colonies/5.5-terraforming.md)) and infrastructure development. More exotic biology might find different worlds habitable but would require terraforming Earth-like worlds instead.

**Other Species Traits**:

- **Lifespan**: Affects how long commanders serve before retirement/death and the general pace of population growth.
- **Population Growth Rate**: How quickly your colonies grow through natural reproduction. Higher rates provide more workers faster but also more mouths to feed.

### Species-Level Modifiers

C# Aurora introduced four species-level attributes that fundamentally differentiate species beyond environmental preferences. These operate at the species level (innate biological traits), distinct from empire-level modifiers which come from technology research.

Each attribute defaults to 1.0, with random variation for generated species:

| Modifier | Default | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Population Growth Rate | 1.0 | Multiplier on natural reproduction rate |
| Population Density | 1.0 | Affects max pop, infrastructure, and habitat capacity |
| Research Rate | 1.0 | Multiplier on all scientist productivity |
| Production Rate | 1.0 | Multiplier on factories, refineries, shipbuilding |

**Key Distinction**: These are species-level modifiers based on innate biological ability. Empire-level modifiers to Research or Production come from technology research and stack separately. A species with a 1.2 Research Rate modifier that also researches a 10% research bonus technology receives both benefits.

**Custom Values**: Player-created species can have custom values assigned to these attributes, allowing for tailored gameplay experiences. For example:

- A high Research Rate (1.3) with low Production Rate (0.8) creates a species that discovers technology quickly but manufactures slowly
- A high Population Density (1.5) allows more colonists on each world, compensating for limited habitable planets
- A high Production Rate (1.2) with low Population Growth (0.7) creates a species that is individually productive but slow to colonize

**Generated Species**: When the game generates NPR species, these attributes receive random variation, creating diversity across different civilizations. This means some NPRs may naturally outproduce or outresearch you based on biology alone, independent of their technological development.

### Diplomatic and Behavioral Attributes

These attributes control how NPRs behave and interact diplomatically. For player races, they primarily affect how other races perceive and interact with you:

| Attribute | Range | Effect |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Determination | 1-100 | How steadfastly the race pursues goals; affects population resistance to occupation |
| Diplomacy | 1-100 | Ability to negotiate; adds to political modifier annually when diplomatic teams are active |
| Expansion | 1-100 | Desire to expand territory; affects NPR colonization speed |
| Militancy | 1-100 | Likelihood of choosing military force; affects garrison requirements |
| Trade | 1-100 | Willingness to establish trade relationships |
| Translation | -25 to +25 | Bonus/penalty to first contact communication attempts |
| Xenophobia | 1-100 | Fear and distrust of other races; subtracts from political modifier annually |

**Key Dynamic**: A high-diplomacy race with low xenophobia can quickly build alliances, while a high-xenophobia, low-diplomacy race will have lasting hostility regardless of peaceful actions. Population resistance to occupation is calculated as (Determination + Militancy + Xenophobia) / 300.

## 2.2.3 Starting Tech Level

The starting technology level is the single most impactful choice in game setup. It determines whether you begin with a century of development ahead or must bootstrap space travel from scratch.

**Conventional Start**:

- Your race begins at roughly current-day technology levels
- You have no Trans-Newtonian (TN) technology — no advanced materials, no efficient drives, no energy weapons
- The game begins with a research phase to discover TN elements and develop basic spacefaring capability
- Your initial industry is conventional (less efficient than TN equivalents)
- This start adds 20-50 years of gameplay before you are truly spacefaring

**Advantages of Conventional Start:**

- Longer, more gradual gameplay arc
- Teaches you the research system thoroughly
- Creates a stronger narrative of discovery and progress
- More time to learn the interface before combat becomes relevant

**Trans-Newtonian Start** (Recommended for most players):

- Your race begins with TN technology already researched
- You have basic engines, fuel refineries, mines, and construction capability
- Ships can be designed and built immediately
- Your homeworld has TN-grade industry already operating
- The game begins with you already capable of interplanetary (and soon interstellar) travel

**Advantages of TN Start:**

- Get into the "meat" of the game faster
- Less time spent waiting for basic research to complete
- Can begin exploring and expanding within the first few in-game years
- Better for players who want to focus on ship design (see [Section 8.1 Design Philosophy](../8-ship-design/8.1-design-philosophy.md)) and fleet operations (see [Section 9.1 Shipyards](../9-fleet-management/9.1-shipyards.md))

**Auto-Assign Tech Points** *(v2.7.1)*: A checkbox available during race creation that, when enabled, automatically researches starting technologies based on the selected government type rather than requiring manual selection. This is particularly valuable for new players who may not know which starting technologies to select or how to allocate their starting tech points effectively. When checked, the game applies a sensible default technology package appropriate for the chosen government type, ensuring your race begins with a coherent and functional set of researched technologies. Experienced players may prefer to leave this unchecked for full control over their starting tech selections.

**Tech Level Details for TN Start:**
You typically begin with:

- Basic nuclear thermal or nuclear pulse engines
- Basic sensors (thermal and electromagnetic)
- Standard armor and construction materials
- Fuel harvesting and refining capability
- Basic missile and beam weapon technology
- Gravitational survey sensors for finding jump points

## 2.2.4 Government Type *(v2.7.1)*

The government type selected during race creation affects starting conditions, available tech points, and ongoing gameplay bonuses. This choice represents the political structure of your civilization and influences both early-game capabilities and long-term strategic options.

**Available Government Types:**

| Government Type | Key Effects |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Democracy | Balanced starting conditions; moderate bonuses across research and production |
| Autocracy | Stronger military bonuses; reduced research flexibility |
| Oligarchy | Enhanced economic output; moderate production bonuses |
| Theocracy | Population loyalty bonuses; unique morale modifiers |
| Corporate | Strong production and trade bonuses; weaker military starting position |
| Communal | High population growth modifiers; distributed production bonuses |
| Militarist | Significant military training and production bonuses; reduced civilian economy |
| Technocracy | Enhanced research rate; bonus starting tech points; weaker initial production |

**Effects on Gameplay:**

- **Starting Tech Points**: Each government type provides a different allocation of starting technology points. Technocracy receives the most, while Militarist and Communal types receive fewer tech points but compensate with other bonuses.
- **Production Modifiers**: Government type applies ongoing modifiers to various production categories (factory output, shipyard speed, mining efficiency) that persist throughout the game.
- **Population and Morale**: Some government types affect population growth rates, colony morale, or unrest mechanics, influencing long-term colonial development.
- **Military Readiness**: Certain types (Militarist, Autocracy) provide training speed bonuses or starting fleet advantages, while others (Corporate, Technocracy) favor civilian development.

**Interaction with Auto-Assign Tech Points**: When the Auto-Assign Tech Points checkbox is enabled, the selected government type determines which technologies are automatically researched at game start. Each government type has a curated technology package reflecting its priorities -- for example, Technocracy auto-assigns more advanced research technologies, while Militarist prioritizes weapon and engine technologies.

> **Tip:** For a first game, Democracy or Technocracy provide the most forgiving starting conditions. Militarist and Autocracy are better suited to experienced players who plan to engage in early conflict.

## 2.2.5 Theme Dropdowns

The race creation window includes several theme dropdowns that control naming conventions throughout the game. All themes are purely cosmetic with no mechanical effects.

**System Theme**: Controls automatic naming of newly discovered star systems. For example, using the US theme generates names derived from US cities. Any system can be manually renamed during gameplay.

**Class Theme**: Controls automatic naming of newly designed ship classes. The US theme generates names like Essex, Lexington, Spruance, and Ticonderoga (historical US Navy vessels). Any ship class can be manually renamed.

**Rank Theme**: Controls military rank structures for officers (ship captains, fleet admirals, ground commanders). Available themes include:
- Real-world military structures (US, German/Deutschland, ASEAN)
- Science fiction ranks (Andromeda High Guard, Terran Federation/Starship Troopers)
- Fantasy-inspired ranks (Tolkien, Rigelian swordsman titles)
- 60+ additional cultural and fictional themes

**Name Theme**: Controls auto-generation of commander first and last names. Each theme includes approximately 2,000 possible first names and 50,000+ possible surnames, generating roughly 100 million unique name combinations per theme. Cultural variants apply different naming conventions (e.g., Roman praenomen/nomen/cognomen structure).

**Commander Capacity**: Your race generates a limited number of commanders based on population and other factors (see [Section 16.1 Officer Generation](../16-commanders/16.1-officer-generation.md)). These individuals have stats (administrative skill, research bonus, tactical ability) that affect their performance in assigned roles.

## 2.2.6 Starting Installations

The right side of the race creation window displays starting values for population and installations. These determine your empire's initial capabilities:

**Population and Economic:**
- **Population (m)**: Starting population in millions on your homeworld
- **Financial Centres**: Generate wealth equivalent to tax from 250,000 workers per centre

**Production Installations:**
- **Shipyards**: Naval and commercial shipyards for ship construction (400 BP/year per slipway at base tech)
- **Construction Factories**: Build installations and infrastructure (10 BP/year per factory)
- **Ordnance Factories**: Build missiles and expendable ordnance (10 BP/year)
- **Fighter Factories**: Produce light naval craft under 1,000 tons (10 BP/year)
- **Conventional Industry**: Pre-TN factories (only present in conventional starts)

**Resource Extraction:**
- **Mines**: Extract minerals from planetary deposits (10 tons/year per mine at 100% accessibility)
- **Automated Mines**: Unmanned mining operations for remote locations
- **Fuel Refineries**: Process Sorium into usable fuel (40,000 litres/year per refinery)

**Research and Military:**
- **Research Facilities**: Generate research points (100 RP/year per lab)
- **Maintenance Facilities**: Produce Maintenance Supply Points (MSP) to prevent ship degradation
- **Ground Force Construction Complexes**: Build ground combat units
- **Deep Space Tracking Stations**: Orbital threat detection installations
- **Military Academies**: Train and generate officers

**Stockpiles:**
- **Fuel Stockpile (litres)**: Starting fuel reserves for fleet operations
- **Maintenance Stockpile (MSP)**: Starting maintenance supplies
- **Starting Tech Points**: Pre-researched technology allocation (varies by government type)
- **Starting Ship Build Points**: Initial shipyard production capacity

## 2.2.7 Custom Race Tips

Experienced players optimize race creation for specific strategies. Here are common approaches and considerations.

**Earth-Normal (Safe Default)**:

- Standard gravity, temperature, and atmosphere settings
- Works well for a first game
- Many tutorial resources assume these settings
- The largest body of community advice applies to Earth-normal races

**Extreme Environment Species**:

- Designing a species that thrives in conditions hostile to Earth-life (high gravity, extreme temperatures, unusual atmospheres)
- Fewer competing NPRs can use your preferred worlds
- But fewer worlds are habitable overall, making each discovery more valuable
- Terraforming targets differ from standard guides

**Fast Growth Strategy**:

- Maximize population growth rate
- Prioritize early colonization of even marginal worlds
- Numbers compensate for individual colony productivity
- Works well with abundant mineral settings

**Research Focus**:

- Allocate creation points toward research bonuses
- Accept slower population growth or narrower habitability
- Aim to out-tech opponents rather than out-produce them
- Pairs well with fewer but more developed colonies

**Military Focus**:

- Prioritize attributes that support faster ship construction and crew training
- Accept other trade-offs
- Designed for players who expect early conflict or want to play aggressively

> **Warning:** The "Random Name" button in the race creation window does not only randomize the race name -- it resets most of the configuration on the screen. Do not press it after configuring your race settings or you will lose all your changes. Use the "Create Race" button when you are finished with configuration.

> **Warning:** Common Mistakes to Avoid
>
> - Do not make gravity tolerance too narrow — you will struggle to find colonizable worlds
> - Do not neglect temperature range — it is one of the most common reasons worlds are unsuitable
> - Extremely exotic atmospheric requirements (breathing chlorine, etc.) make the game harder without proportional benefit for new players
> - Population growth rate compounds over time — even small differences become enormous over centuries of game time
