# 2.2 Race Creation

*Added: v2026.01.23*

## 2.2.1 Race Identity

The top of the Create New Race window contains text fields for basic race identification \hyperlink{ref-2.2-1}{[1]}:

- **Race Title**: The full name of your race or empire (e.g., "Player Race").

- **Race Short Name**: An abbreviated name (e.g., "Player Race").

- **Homeworld Name**: The name of your species' home planet (e.g., "Earth").

## 2.2.2 Race Creation Checkboxes

The Create New Race window includes several checkboxes that control fundamental race behavior \hyperlink{ref-2.2-1}{[1]}:

- **Non-Player Race**: Designates whether the race is controlled by the AI or the player \hyperlink{ref-2.2-8}{[8]}. When enabled, the race becomes an NPR (Non-Player Race) with autonomous AI behavior. When disabled, you control the race directly.

- **Industrial (Low Tech)**: Sets the race to start with pre-industrial or basic conventional technology levels with minimal infrastructure \hyperlink{ref-2.2-8}{[8]}. When disabled (recommended for most players), the race starts with Trans-Newtonian (TN) technology already researched.

  **Conventional Start** (checkbox enabled):
  - Your race begins at roughly current-day technology levels with no Trans-Newtonian technology
  - No advanced materials, no efficient drives, no energy weapons
  - The game begins with a research phase to discover TN elements and develop basic spacefaring capability
  - Adds 20-50 years of gameplay before you are truly spacefaring *(community estimate)*
  - Advantages: Longer gameplay arc, teaches research system, more time to learn interface

  **Trans-Newtonian Start** (checkbox disabled):
  - Your race begins with TN technology already researched (basic engines, fuel refineries, mines, construction capability)
  - Ships can be designed and built immediately; homeworld has TN-grade industry operating
  - You typically begin with: basic nuclear thermal or nuclear pulse engines, basic sensors, standard armor, fuel harvesting/refining, basic missile and beam weapons, and gravitational survey sensors
  - Advantages: Get into the core gameplay faster, can begin exploring within first few in-game years, better for players focused on ship design and fleet operations

- **Neutral Race**: Establishes a guaranteed neutral relationship with other races sharing the same starting system \hyperlink{ref-2.2-8}{[8]}. Useful for multi-faction starts without immediate conflict.

- **Auto-Assign Tech Points**: Automatically researches starting technologies rather than requiring manual selection \hyperlink{ref-2.2-8}{[8]}. Recommended for new players.

- **Auto-Design Ground Forces**: Automatically generates starting ground unit designs and templates \hyperlink{ref-2.2-8}{[8]}. When disabled, you must manually design all ground force units.

- **Auto-Design Ship Classes**: Automatically generates starting ship class designs \hyperlink{ref-2.2-8}{[8]}. When disabled, you must manually design all ship classes from scratch.

- **Home System Geo Surveyed**: When enabled, your home system starts with geological surveys complete, revealing all mineral deposits \hyperlink{ref-2.2-8}{[8]}. When disabled, you must survey your own home system.

- **Home System Grav Surveyed**: When enabled, your home system starts with gravitational surveys complete, revealing all jump points \hyperlink{ref-2.2-8}{[8]}. When disabled, you must discover jump points in your own system.

## 2.2.3 Visual Customization

The center of the Create New Race window displays visual elements for your race. Each element can be customized using the corresponding button in [Section 2.2.7 Interface Buttons](#227-interface-buttons):

- **Race Portrait**: The leader/representative image for your race, shown in diplomacy screens and race displays.

- **Ship Hull Silhouette**: A preview of the default ship hull appearance for this race.

- **Station Silhouette**: A preview of the default orbital station appearance for this race.

- **Race Flag**: The flag image representing your race, displayed in diplomacy screens and fleet identifiers.

## 2.2.4 Species Attributes

The left side of the race creation window displays species attributes. These determine biological preferences, production modifiers, and behavioral traits \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}. Listed in order as they appear on screen:

- **Species Name**: The name of your species (e.g., "Human"). Appears in species-related displays and intelligence reports.

- **Ideal Gravity (G)**: The gravity your species is most comfortable at (Earth = 1.0) \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Ideal Temperature (C)**: The surface temperature your species prefers (Earth = approximately 14C) \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Ideal Oxygen Pressure (atm)**: The oxygen partial pressure your species requires (Earth = 0.20 atm) \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Maximum Atmospheric Pressure (atm)**: The maximum total atmospheric pressure your species can tolerate (Earth default = 4.0 atm) \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Maximum Gravity Deviation (G)**: How far from ideal gravity your species can tolerate (Earth default = 0.9, yielding range 0.1G to 1.9G) \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}. Colonies outside this range suffer productivity penalties.

- **Maximum Temperature Deviation (C)**: How far from ideal temperature your species can tolerate (Earth default = +/-24C) \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}. Worlds outside this range require infrastructure modifications.

- **Maximum Oxygen Deviation (atm)**: How far from ideal oxygen pressure your species can tolerate (Earth default = +/-0.1 atm) \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Population Density Modifier**: Multiplier affecting max population, infrastructure, and habitat capacity (default 1.0) \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Population Growth Modifier**: Multiplier on natural reproduction rate (default 1.0) \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Research Rate Modifier**: Multiplier on all scientist productivity (default 1.0) \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Factory Production Modifier**: Multiplier on factories, refineries, and shipbuilding (default 1.0) \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Determination (1-100)**: How steadfastly the race pursues goals; affects population resistance to occupation \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Diplomacy (1-100)**: Ability to negotiate; adds to political modifier annually when diplomatic teams are active \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Expansion (1-100)**: Desire to expand territory; affects NPR colonization speed \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Militancy (1-100)**: Likelihood of choosing military force; affects garrison requirements \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Trade (1-100)**: Willingness to establish trade relationships \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Translation (-25 to +25)**: Bonus/penalty to first contact communication attempts \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Xenophobia (1-100)**: Fear and distrust of other races; subtracts from political modifier annually \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}.

- **Officer Graduation Age**: The age at which new officers enter service (default 21) \hyperlink{ref-2.2-9}{[9]}. Affects how long officers serve before retirement.

**Key Dynamic**: A high-diplomacy race with low xenophobia can quickly build alliances, while a high-xenophobia, low-diplomacy race will have lasting hostility regardless of peaceful actions. Population resistance to occupation is calculated as (Determination + Militancy + Xenophobia) / 300 *(unverified)*.

## 2.2.5 Theme Dropdowns

The race creation window includes several theme dropdowns that control naming conventions throughout the game. All themes are purely cosmetic with no mechanical effects.

**Species**: Selects a predefined species template. Changing this dropdown loads preset values for species attributes (gravity, temperature, atmosphere preferences, etc.). You can select a template as a starting point and then customize individual attributes.

**System Theme**: Controls automatic naming of newly discovered star systems. For example, using the US theme generates names derived from US cities. Any system can be manually renamed during gameplay.

**Class Theme**: Controls automatic naming of newly designed ship classes. The US theme generates names like Essex, Lexington, Spruance, and Ticonderoga (historical US Navy vessels). Any ship class can be manually renamed.

**Rank Theme**: Controls military rank structures for officers (ship captains, fleet admirals, ground commanders). Available themes include:
- Real-world military structures (US, German/Deutschland, ASEAN)
- Science fiction ranks (Andromeda High Guard, Terran Federation/Starship Troopers)
- Fantasy-inspired ranks (Tolkien, Rigelian swordsman titles)
- 77 additional cultural and fictional themes \hyperlink{ref-2.2-2}{[2]}

**Name Theme**: Controls auto-generation of commander first and last names. Name counts vary widely by theme -- for example, the Japanese (Nihon) theme includes 1,703 first names and 50,000 surnames, while most themes range from a few hundred to several thousand names each \hyperlink{ref-2.2-3}{[3]}. The database contains 130,843 total name entries across 79 commander name themes. Cultural variants apply different naming conventions (e.g., Roman praenomen/nomen/cognomen structure).

## 2.2.7 Interface Buttons

The bottom of the Create New Race window contains several buttons:

- **Create Race**: Finalizes the race configuration and adds the race to the game. Use this when you are finished configuring all settings.

- **Change Flag / Change Image / Change Hull / Change Station**: Open dialogs to customize the corresponding visual elements described in [Section 2.2.3 Visual Customization](#223-visual-customization).

- **Random Name**: Randomizes the race name. **Warning:** This button resets most configuration on the screen, not just the name \hyperlink{ref-2.2-15}{[15]}. Do not press it after configuring your race settings or you will lose all your changes.

## 2.2.8 Custom Race Tips

Experienced players optimize race creation for specific strategies. Here are common approaches and considerations.

**Earth-Normal (Safe Default)**:

- Standard gravity, temperature, and atmosphere settings
- Works well for a first game
- Many tutorial resources assume these settings
- The largest body of community advice applies to Earth-normal races

**Extreme Environment Species**:

- Designing a species that thrives in conditions hostile to Earth-life (high gravity, extreme temperatures, unusual atmospheres)
- Fewer competing NPRs can use your preferred worlds
- But fewer worlds are habitable overall, making each discovery more valuable
- Terraforming targets differ from standard guides

**Fast Growth Strategy**:

- Maximize population growth rate
- Prioritize early colonization of even marginal worlds
- Numbers compensate for individual colony productivity
- Works well with abundant mineral settings

**Research Focus**:

- Allocate creation points toward research bonuses
- Accept slower population growth or narrower habitability
- Aim to out-tech opponents rather than out-produce them
- Pairs well with fewer but more developed colonies

**Military Focus**:

- Prioritize attributes that support faster ship construction and crew training
- Accept other trade-offs
- Designed for players who expect early conflict or want to play aggressively

> **Warning:** Common Mistakes to Avoid
>
> - Do not make gravity tolerance too narrow — you will struggle to find colonizable worlds
> - Do not neglect temperature range — it is one of the most common reasons worlds are unsuitable
> - Extremely exotic atmospheric requirements (breathing chlorine, etc.) make the game harder without proportional benefit for new players
> - Population growth rate compounds over time — even small differences become enormous over centuries of game time
