# 2.2 Race Creation

## 2.2.1 Species Attributes

Your species' biological attributes determine which worlds are habitable without environmental modification and what conditions your colonists can tolerate. These choices are permanent and shape your entire colonization strategy.

**Gravity Tolerance**:
- **Homeworld Gravity**: Sets the gravity of your homeworld (Earth = 1.0). Your species is most comfortable at this gravity.
- **Gravity Range**: Defines the minimum and maximum gravity your species can tolerate without infrastructure penalties. Colonies outside this range suffer significant productivity reductions.
- Practical range: Most players use 0.1 to 3.0 as the comfortable band. Narrow gravity tolerance makes fewer worlds habitable but gives more creation points for other attributes.

**Temperature**:
- **Ideal Temperature**: The surface temperature your species prefers (Earth = approximately 14C / 57F).
- **Temperature Range**: The variance from ideal that your species can tolerate. Worlds outside this range require environmental suits or infrastructure modifications.
- Temperature is one of the most restrictive colonization factors — many otherwise suitable worlds have extreme temperatures.

**Atmospheric Requirements**:
Your species requires specific atmospheric conditions:
- **Base Atmosphere**: The gas your species breathes (oxygen for humans). Worlds lacking this gas require sealed habitats or terraforming.
- **Atmospheric Pressure**: Minimum and maximum tolerable pressure. Too thin or too thick and your colonists cannot survive unprotected.
- **Dangerous Gases**: Gases that are toxic to your species (for humans, this includes things like chlorine). Even small concentrations of dangerous gases render a world uninhabitable without protection.
- **Oxygen/Nitrogen Balance**: The specific mix of breathable gases your species requires.

**Practical Impact**: These biological settings determine what percentage of generated worlds are immediately habitable. Earth-standard settings (the default) typically yield few naturally habitable worlds, encouraging terraforming and infrastructure development. More exotic biology might find different worlds habitable but would require terraforming Earth-like worlds instead.

**Other Species Traits**:
- **Lifespan**: Affects how long commanders serve before retirement/death and the general pace of population growth.
- **Population Growth Rate**: How quickly your colonies grow through natural reproduction. Higher rates provide more workers faster but also more mouths to feed.

## 2.2.2 Starting Tech Level

The starting technology level is the single most impactful choice in game setup. It determines whether you begin with a century of development ahead or must bootstrap space travel from scratch.

**Conventional Start**:
- Your race begins at roughly current-day technology levels
- You have no Trans-Newtonian (TN) technology — no advanced materials, no efficient drives, no energy weapons
- The game begins with a research phase to discover TN elements and develop basic spacefaring capability
- Your initial industry is conventional (less efficient than TN equivalents)
- This start adds 20-50 years of gameplay before you are truly spacefaring

**Advantages of Conventional Start:**
- Longer, more gradual gameplay arc
- Teaches you the research system thoroughly
- Creates a stronger narrative of discovery and progress
- More time to learn the interface before combat becomes relevant

**Trans-Newtonian Start** (Recommended for most players):
- Your race begins with TN technology already researched
- You have basic engines, fuel refineries, mines, and construction capability
- Ships can be designed and built immediately
- Your homeworld has TN-grade industry already operating
- The game begins with you already capable of interplanetary (and soon interstellar) travel

**Advantages of TN Start:**
- Get into the "meat" of the game faster
- Less time spent waiting for basic research to complete
- Can begin exploring and expanding within the first few in-game years
- Better for players who want to focus on ship design and fleet operations

**Tech Level Details for TN Start:**
You typically begin with:
- Basic nuclear thermal or nuclear pulse engines
- Basic sensors (thermal and electromagnetic)
- Standard armor and construction materials
- Fuel harvesting and refining capability
- Basic missile and beam weapon technology
- Gravitational survey sensors for finding jump points

## 2.2.3 Commander Theme

Commanders in Aurora are named individuals who serve as ship captains, fleet admirals, scientists, governors, and ground force leaders. The commander theme determines how these individuals are named.

**Name Generation Themes**:
Aurora includes numerous naming themes based on real-world cultures and nations:
- **American/British/European**: Western name pools
- **Russian**: Slavic name generation
- **Chinese/Japanese/Korean**: East Asian names
- **Arabic**: Middle Eastern names
- **Generic Sci-Fi**: Non-cultural science fiction names
- **And many more**: The game includes a wide variety of cultural name pools

**Theme Effects**:
- The theme affects only cosmetic naming — there is no mechanical difference between themes
- Commander names appear throughout the interface: ship assignments, research projects, fleet commands, colony governance
- Choosing a theme that resonates with your narrative vision enhances immersion

**Custom Names**: You can manually rename any commander at any time, regardless of theme. The theme only affects auto-generated names for new commanders.

**Commander Capacity**: Your race generates a limited number of commanders based on population and other factors. These individuals have stats (administrative skill, research bonus, tactical ability) that affect their performance in assigned roles.

## 2.2.4 Custom Race Tips

Experienced players optimize race creation for specific strategies. Here are common approaches and considerations.

**Earth-Normal (Safe Default)**:
- Standard gravity, temperature, and atmosphere settings
- Works well for a first game
- Many tutorial resources assume these settings
- The largest body of community advice applies to Earth-normal races

**Extreme Environment Species**:
- Designing a species that thrives in conditions hostile to Earth-life (high gravity, extreme temperatures, unusual atmospheres)
- Fewer competing NPRs can use your preferred worlds
- But fewer worlds are habitable overall, making each discovery more valuable
- Terraforming targets differ from standard guides

**Fast Growth Strategy**:
- Maximize population growth rate
- Prioritize early colonization of even marginal worlds
- Numbers compensate for individual colony productivity
- Works well with abundant mineral settings

**Research Focus**:
- Allocate creation points toward research bonuses
- Accept slower population growth or narrower habitability
- Aim to out-tech opponents rather than out-produce them
- Pairs well with fewer but more developed colonies

**Military Focus**:
- Prioritize attributes that support faster ship construction and crew training
- Accept other trade-offs
- Designed for players who expect early conflict or want to play aggressively

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Do not make gravity tolerance too narrow — you will struggle to find colonizable worlds
- Do not neglect temperature range — it is one of the most common reasons worlds are unsuitable
- Extremely exotic atmospheric requirements (breathing chlorine, etc.) make the game harder without proportional benefit for new players
- Population growth rate compounds over time — even small differences become enormous over centuries of game time
