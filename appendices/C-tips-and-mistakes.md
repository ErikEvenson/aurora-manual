# Appendix C: Tips and Common Mistakes

## C.1 New Player Mistakes

### Forgetting to Assign Research Labs

One of the most common mistakes is building research labs but forgetting to assign them to a research project with a scientist (see [Section 7 Research](../7-research/7.1-technology-tree.md)). Labs produce nothing until assigned. Check the Research window regularly and ensure every lab has a project and a scientist assigned.

### Not Building Enough Fuel Infrastructure

New players often run out of fuel unexpectedly. Fuel is consumed constantly by moving ships (see [Section 14 Logistics](../14-logistics/14.1-supply-chains.md)), and a single fleet action can drain your reserves. Build fuel refineries early, establish Sorium mining on accessible deposits, and consider fuel harvesters at gas giants. A good rule of thumb: have at least twice the fuel production you think you need.

### Designing Ships Without Bridges

Any ship that needs to operate outside your home system requires a bridge (see [Section 8 Ship Design](../8-ship-design/8.1-design-overview.md)). Forgetting this component means the ship cannot receive orders once it leaves orbit. Always include a bridge on combat and exploration vessels. The only exception is PDCs (Planetary Defense Centers) that never move.

### Ignoring Maintenance

Ships accumulate maintenance requirements over time (see [Appendix A Formulas](../appendices/A-formulas.md) for failure rate calculations). Without periodic overhaul at a maintenance facility, components begin failing randomly. Failures in combat can be catastrophic. Build maintenance facilities early and schedule regular overhauls before the maintenance clock expires.

### Sending Unarmed Survey Ships Into Unknown Space

Geological and gravitational survey vessels (see [Section 17 Exploration](../17-exploration/17.1-geological-survey.md)) are typically unarmed to maximize survey speed. Sending them into unexplored systems without escort is a gamble. If they encounter hostiles, they will be destroyed with no ability to fight back. Either escort survey ships with combat vessels or accept the risk.

### Not Building Enough Mines

New players often focus entirely on construction factories and neglect mining. Without minerals, factories have nothing to build. A healthy ratio is approximately 2-3 mines for every construction factory, depending on local mineral accessibility.

### Forgetting Jump Drives

Building a fleet and then realizing none of your ships have jump drives (see [Section 10 Navigation](../10-navigation/10.1-jump-points.md)) is a painful lesson. Either equip each combat ship with a military jump drive (instantaneous self-transit) or include a jump-capable tender in each fleet (commercial jump drive, squadron transit). Jump gates at established points eliminate this need but take time to construct.

### Not Checking Colony Cost Before Colonizing

Sending colonists to a planet with high colony cost (see [Section 5 Colonies](../5-colonies/5.1-colonization.md)) without first shipping infrastructure results in population attrition. Always check colony cost first, and if non-zero, send infrastructure before or with your colonists.

### Building Only One Type of Ship

Diversity matters. An all-missile fleet runs out of ordnance. An all-beam fleet cannot engage at range. An all-frigate fleet lacks staying power. Mix your designs to cover different engagement ranges and threat types.

### Neglecting Point Defense

The first time an enemy missile salvo destroys your flagship in a single volley, you learn to value point defense (see [Section 12 Combat](../12-combat/12.1-combat-overview.md)). Every combat fleet should include dedicated PD platforms or ensure combat ships carry CIWS and AMM launchers. Missile defense is not optional.

## C.2 Economic Tips

### Prioritize Gallicite Early

Gallicite is used for engine construction (see [Appendix D Reference Tables](../appendices/D-reference-tables.md)) and is often the first mineral to become scarce. Prioritize geological surveys to find Gallicite deposits and establish mining operations early. Running out of Gallicite halts all engine production, which halts all ship construction.

### Use Conventional Industry Wisely

Conventional Industry does not require TN minerals and can produce infrastructure, ground forces, and some basic installations. Keep your Conventional Industry active producing infrastructure while your TN factories handle advanced projects. This is essentially free production capacity.

### Automate Freight Routes

Manual cargo management becomes overwhelming quickly. Set up standing orders for freighters to move minerals from mining colonies to your homeworld. Use the automated task group orders (load minerals, unload at colony, repeat) to minimize micromanagement.

### Governor Selection Matters

A governor (see [Section 16.3 Assignments](../16-commanders/16.3-assignments.md)) with high Manufacturing skill dramatically increases factory output. A skill-25 Manufacturing governor adds 125% bonus production. Assign your best Manufacturing-skilled commanders to your primary industrial worlds.

### Do Not Overbuild Shipyards

Shipyards are extremely expensive in BP and minerals. Build the minimum number needed and expand capacity gradually. One large shipyard with multiple slipways is more efficient than many small shipyards. Plan your ship classes around a few standardized tonnages to minimize retooling.

### Mineral Stockpile Awareness

Check your mineral consumption rates against production rates regularly. If you are consuming Duranium faster than mining it, you will eventually run out regardless of current stockpile size. The Economics window shows production and consumption; use it.

### Research Lab Concentration vs Distribution

Concentrating many labs on one project gives diminishing returns (each additional lab beyond the first contributes 50% less). Spreading labs across multiple projects advances your technology on a broader front. The optimal strategy depends on your immediate needs.

### Financial Centers for Wealth

If wealth is limiting your construction, build Financial Centers. Each adds to your annual income. A modest investment in Financial Centers pays for itself quickly through increased construction budgets.

### Scrap Obsolete Installations

As you research improved versions of mines, factories, and refineries, the older versions become inefficient. Scrapping them recovers some minerals and frees up capacity for improved versions.

### Colonize for Minerals, Not Just Habitability

An ideal world with no minerals is less valuable than a harsh world with rich, accessible deposits. When choosing colony targets, mineral wealth should be a primary consideration. Infrastructure can make almost any world habitable.

## C.3 Military Tips

### Design Ships for a Role

Every ship should have a clear purpose (see [Section 8 Ship Design](../8-ship-design/8.1-design-overview.md)): missile combatant, beam combatant, point defense escort, sensor picket, or support vessel. Ships that try to do everything do nothing well. Specialization within a fleet is superior to generalization within a hull.

### Sensor Pickets Save Lives

Dedicate a small, fast ship class to long-range active sensors. Station these pickets at jump points and along approach vectors. Early detection gives you time to position your fleet advantageously. A few hundred tons of sensor ship is worth more than a battlecruiser in terms of strategic value.

### Ammunition Logistics

Missile ships are useless without ordnance. Build ordnance factories and maintain stockpiles of your primary missile types. Include ammunition colliers in your fleet train to resupply ships in the field. Running out of missiles mid-battle is effectively a defeat.

### Speed Is Life

Faster ships choose engagement range. If you are faster than the enemy, you can maintain optimal range (your weapons' sweet spot) while staying outside their effective range. When designing combat ships, speed should be a primary consideration, not an afterthought.

### Armor Depth Over Armor Width

Ship armor is distributed in columns. Adding more armor layers (depth) to each column is more protective than spreading the same armor mass across more columns (which happens automatically with ship tonnage). Deep armor on a smaller hull is often more survivable than thin armor on a larger hull.

### AMM Doctrine

Anti-Missile Missiles should be small and fast with the highest possible agility. A size-1 AMM with maximum engine allocation intercepts reliably and you can carry hundreds in a single magazine. Quantity beats quality for point defense missiles.

### Do Not Neglect Training

Higher crew grade improves combat performance. Keep training cycles running during peacetime. Well-trained crews reload faster, track targets better, and recover from damage more effectively.

### Retreat Is a Valid Tactic

If a battle is going poorly, retreating to resupply and return with full magazines is better than losing your fleet. Ships can be repaired; destroyed ships are gone permanently. Know when to disengage.

### Jump Point Defense

If you expect an attack through a specific jump point, station your fleet at the maximum sensor range from that point. This gives you detection time and space to maneuver. Stationing directly on the jump point risks being surprised at point-blank range.

### Mixed Missile Salvos

Consider mixing large anti-ship missiles with faster, smaller decoys in the same salvo. Enemy point defense may expend ammunition on the cheaper missiles, allowing your heavy warheads to get through. This requires careful timing of launch sequences.

### ECM Is Cost-Effective

A few levels of ECM on your combat ships dramatically reduces incoming beam accuracy. The tonnage cost is small relative to the survivability improvement. Even ECM-1 or ECM-2 forces the enemy to close range for effective fire.

### Repair Ships Are Essential

Include a repair ship (with engineering spaces and MSP storage) in any fleet operating far from maintenance facilities. The ability to repair battle damage in the field without returning to port is a massive strategic advantage.

### Layer Your Defenses

A comprehensive defense plan includes: long-range sensor detection, missile engagement at maximum range, AMM interception at medium range, CIWS interception at close range, shields for residual hits, and deep armor as the last resort. No single layer is sufficient alone.

## C.4 Quality of Life

### Use the Notepad

Aurora C# includes an in-game notepad. Use it to track your strategic plans, mineral bottlenecks, ship class designations, and fleet assignments. The game generates enormous amounts of data; having a personal reference prevents losing track.

### Name Your Designs Clearly

Use systematic naming conventions for ship classes and missile designs. Include the role, generation, and key statistics in the name. "DD-Mk3-Laser-5000km/s" is more useful than "Destroyer III" when reviewing your fleet six months later.

### Check the Events Log

After advancing time, especially with large increments, always check the events log for important notifications. Missed events can cascade into larger problems (a maintenance failure leading to a stranded ship, for example).

### Save Frequently

Aurora C# auto-saves, but manual saves before major decisions (fleet engagements, large production changes, exploration into unknown space) give you recovery points. The game is complex enough that mistakes can be costly.

### Use the Comparison Window

When designing ships, use the class comparison features to evaluate different designs against each other. This helps identify whether that extra engine is worth the fuel cost, or whether your armor is sufficient against expected threats.

### Organize Fleets by Role

Create separate task groups for different roles: a survey group, a patrol group, a strike group, a logistics group. This makes issuing orders faster and reduces the chance of accidentally sending your survey ships into combat.

### Monitor Fuel Levels

Ships with low fuel are operationally useless. Set up tanker routes to keep forward-deployed fleets fueled. Check fleet fuel status before issuing long-range movement orders. A fleet that runs out of fuel in hostile space is a fleet that dies.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Learn the keyboard shortcuts for time increments and common windows. Pressing the increment hotkeys is dramatically faster than clicking the buttons, especially during combat when you may be stepping through hundreds of 5-second increments.

### Set Up Standing Orders Early

For routine operations (mineral hauling, fuel distribution, colony resupply), set up repeating fleet orders early. This reduces the micromanagement burden as your empire grows and lets you focus on strategic decisions rather than logistics.

### Review Ship Designs Periodically

As your technology advances, older ship designs become obsolete. Periodically review your active designs and update them to use current technology. A refit is often cheaper than building entirely new ships but provides significant capability improvements.

### Use the Commander Window

Check your commander roster regularly for promotions, retirements, and skill improvements. A newly promoted admiral with high tactical skill is wasted sitting in a reserve pool. Assign your best officers to active commands.

### Backup Your Database

Aurora C# stores game data in a database file. Back up this file periodically, especially before major version updates. Corruption, while rare, can end a campaign if no backup exists.
