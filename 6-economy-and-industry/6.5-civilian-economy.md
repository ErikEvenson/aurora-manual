# 6.5 Civilian Economy

Aurora C# features an autonomous civilian economy that operates alongside your government-controlled military and industrial operations. Civilian entities build ships, establish mining colonies, and run trade routes without direct player orders. Understanding how to encourage and leverage the civilian sector is key to efficient empire management.

## 6.5.1 Civilian Shipping Lines

Civilian shipping lines are autonomous companies that build and operate commercial vessels within your empire. They appear naturally as your civilisation develops.

**How They Form:**

- Civilian shipping lines begin forming once your empire reaches a certain level of development (typically when you have multiple colonies with significant population).
- New shipping lines appear periodically as your economy grows.
- Each shipping line operates independently, building ships and establishing routes based on economic opportunity.
- The number of active shipping lines scales with your empire's overall economic development.

**What They Do:**

Civilian shipping lines perform several valuable functions:

- **Cargo Transport:** They move minerals, supplies, and goods between your colonies, supplementing (or replacing) your government freighter fleet.
- **Passenger Transport:** They move population between colonies, helping to distribute citizens to where they are needed.
- **Trade:** They generate wealth through commercial trade operations between colonies.
- **Fuel Transport:** Some civilian ships carry fuel between colonies and fuel depots.

**Civilian Ship Construction:**

- Civilian shipping lines build their own ships at commercial shipyards.
- They pay for construction using their own profits (this does not cost you minerals or wealth directly).
- Ship designs are generated automatically based on available technology and commercial needs.
- Civilian ships use commercial engines (larger but cheaper than military engines) and do not carry weapons.
- Over time, civilian fleets can become quite large, providing substantial logistical capacity.

**Civilian Ship Types:**

- **Freighters:** Carry minerals and installations between colonies.
- **Colony Ships:** Transport population to new or growing colonies.
- **Fuel Tankers:** Move fuel between production sites and consumers.
- **Passenger Liners:** Move smaller population groups and generate trade income.

**Encouraging Civilian Growth:**

You can accelerate civilian economy development by:
- Establishing multiple colonies (more trade endpoints = more opportunity).
- Building commercial shipyards (civilian lines need yards to build ships).
- Maintaining safe shipping lanes (civilian ships avoid dangerous areas).
- Developing colony infrastructure (more developed colonies attract more trade).
- Having a stable economy (wealth and mineral availability influence civilian confidence).

> **Tip:** The civilian economy is essentially free logistical capacity. Every ton of cargo moved by civilian ships is a ton your government freighters do not need to haul. Invest in commercial shipyard capacity early and the civilian sector will eventually handle most of your routine logistics.

## 6.5.2 Civilian Mining

In addition to trade, civilian entities can establish their own mining colonies on resource-rich bodies within your empire.

**How Civilian Mining Works:**

- Civilian mining companies identify bodies with valuable mineral deposits.
- They establish small mining colonies autonomously, without player direction.
- Extracted minerals are added to your empire's stockpile (or transported to your main colonies by civilian freighters).
- Civilian mining colonies build their own automated mines and infrastructure.

**Where Civilians Mine:**

- Bodies with high-accessibility mineral deposits are preferred by civilian miners.
- Civilians generally prefer bodies within established systems (where your control is secure).
- They may establish mines on asteroids, moons, or planets that you have not prioritized for government mining.
- Civilians avoid bodies in systems with known hostile presence.

**Benefits of Civilian Mining:**

- **Free Mineral Income:** Minerals extracted by civilian mines cost you nothing to produce.
- **Broader Coverage:** Civilians may exploit deposits you have overlooked or deprioritized.
- **Reduced Logistics:** Civilian freighters handle mineral transport from civilian mines.
- **Supplemental Supply:** Civilian mining supplements government mining, increasing total mineral throughput.

**Limitations:**

- You cannot directly control where civilians choose to mine.
- Civilian mining output is generally smaller than a dedicated government mining colony.
- Civilians may not prioritize the minerals you most urgently need.
- If a civilian mining colony is destroyed (by alien attack, etc.), replacing it takes time as civilians must choose to re-establish it.

> **Tip:** Civilian mining is a "set and forget" benefit -- you cannot micromanage it, but you can encourage it by surveying bodies and maintaining safe systems. Think of it as bonus mineral income that grows with your empire.

## 6.5.3 Managing Civilians

While the civilian economy operates autonomously, the player has several indirect tools to influence and benefit from civilian activity.

**Civilian Economy Controls:**

- **Commercial Shipyard Priority:** You can prioritize civilian construction orders at your commercial shipyards. Government orders can be set to take priority, or you can allow civilians to use excess capacity.
- **Subsidies:** In some cases, you can subsidize civilian shipping line construction to accelerate fleet growth.
- **Shipping Line Contracts:** Civilian shipping can be contracted for specific government tasks (troop transport, mineral hauling) at a wealth cost.

**Monitoring the Civilian Economy:**

The civilian economy status is visible in several game windows:
- **Civilian Shipping Lines:** Shows all active shipping lines, their fleet sizes, and current operations.
- **Civilian Trade Routes:** Displays active trade routes and their income.
- **Civilian Mining:** Lists active civilian mining colonies and their output.
- **Civilian Fleet:** Shows all civilian ships, their types, locations, and current orders.

**Protecting Civilian Assets:**

Civilian ships and colonies are vulnerable to attack. Player responsibilities include:
- Providing military escorts in potentially dangerous systems.
- Maintaining sensor coverage to detect threats before they reach trade lanes.
- Garrisoning systems with civilian mining colonies.
- Responding quickly to distress signals from civilian ships under attack.
- Clearing hostile forces from systems before civilian traffic resumes.

**Civilian Economy and Expansion:**

The civilian economy naturally supports expansion:
- When you establish a new colony, civilian shipping lines begin servicing it (assuming safe routes exist).
- As colonies grow, civilian trade income increases.
- Civilian population transport can supplement your colony ships.
- In mature empires, the civilian economy can handle the majority of inter-colony logistics, freeing your government ships for military purposes.

**Civilian Economy Pitfalls:**

- **Over-reliance:** Do not depend entirely on civilian logistics for critical military supply chains. Civilians may reroute away from dangerous areas precisely when you need supplies most.
- **Shipyard Competition:** Civilian orders at commercial shipyards compete with government orders. If you need a freighter urgently, civilian orders may delay it.
- **Vulnerability:** A single raider in a trade lane can devastate civilian shipping, cutting off colony supply lines. Maintain patrol coverage.
- **Uncontrollable Priorities:** Civilians optimise for profit, not for your strategic needs. They may ignore critical mineral shortages in favour of more profitable routes.

> **Tip:** The civilian economy is a powerful ally but an unreliable one in wartime. Maintain enough government logistical capacity to sustain critical operations independently of civilian trade. Use the civilian economy as a peacetime efficiency multiplier, not a strategic dependency.
