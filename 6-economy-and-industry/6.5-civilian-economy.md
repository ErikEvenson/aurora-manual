# 6.5 Civilian Economy

Aurora C# features an autonomous civilian economy that operates alongside your government-controlled military and industrial operations. Civilian entities build ships, establish mining colonies, and run trade routes without direct player orders. Understanding how to encourage and leverage the civilian sector is key to efficient empire management.

## 6.5.1 Civilian Shipping Lines

Civilian shipping lines are autonomous companies that build and operate commercial vessels within your empire. They appear naturally as your civilisation develops.

### Game Settings

Two game-creation flags control civilian shipping behaviour:

- **Active Civilian Shipping Lines:** When disabled, shipping lines will not produce ships
- **Civilian Harvesters:** When disabled, shipping lines will not build fuel harvesters

### How They Form

- Civilian shipping lines begin forming once your empire reaches a certain level of development (typically when you have multiple colonies with significant population)
- New shipping lines appear periodically as your economy grows
- Each shipping line operates independently, building ships and establishing routes based on economic opportunity
- The number of active shipping lines scales with your empire's overall economic development

### What They Do

Civilian shipping lines perform several valuable functions:

- **Cargo Transport:** They move minerals, supplies, and goods between your colonies, supplementing (or replacing) your government freighter fleet
- **Passenger Transport:** They move population between colonies, helping to distribute citizens to where they are needed
- **Trade:** They generate wealth through commercial trade operations between colonies
- **Infrastructure Delivery:** They transport infrastructure (both normal and LG-Infrastructure) to colonies that need it, matching the correct type to the destination body
- **Fuel Harvesting:** They can build and operate fuel harvesters at gas giants (if the game setting is enabled)

### Trade Route Algorithm

The C# civilian trade algorithm is significantly improved over VB6. Freighters without active orders search known space systematically:

1. Identify the closest population with export trade goods, accounting for other freighters already en route
2. Find the nearest population requiring that trade good as an import
3. If no suitable destination exists, check other trade goods, then expand to next-closest populations
4. The system checks every possible combination of populations and trade good routes in known space

Infrastructure transport is prioritised before other trade goods, and routes include Lagrange point shortcuts where beneficial.

### Civilian Ship Construction

- Civilian shipping lines build their own ships at commercial shipyards
- They pay for construction using their own profits (this does not cost you minerals or wealth directly)
- Ship designs are generated automatically based on available technology and commercial needs
- Civilian ships use commercial engines (larger but cheaper than military engines) and do not carry weapons
- Over time, civilian fleets can become quite large, providing substantial logistical capacity

### Civilian Ship Types

- **Freighters:** Carry minerals, installations, and trade goods between colonies
- **Colony Ships:** Transport population to new or growing colonies
- **Fuel Tankers:** Move fuel between production sites and consumers
- **Fuel Harvesters:** Harvest Sorium from gas giants (if enabled)

### Encouraging Civilian Growth

You can accelerate civilian economy development by:
- Establishing multiple colonies (more trade endpoints = more opportunity)
- Building commercial shipyards (civilian lines need yards to build ships)
- Maintaining safe shipping lanes (civilian ships avoid dangerous areas)
- Developing colony infrastructure (more developed colonies attract more trade)
- Having a stable economy (wealth and mineral availability influence civilian confidence)

> **Tip:** The civilian economy is essentially free logistical capacity. Every ton of cargo moved by civilian ships is a ton your government freighters do not need to haul. Invest in commercial shipyard capacity early and the civilian sector will eventually handle most of your routine logistics.

## 6.5.2 Civilian Mining

In addition to trade, civilian entities can establish their own mining colonies on resource-rich bodies within your empire. The C# system uses a probability-based algorithm to determine when and where new mining complexes appear.

### Establishment Mechanics

Civilian mining colonies are created through an automated system checked each construction phase:

**Eligibility:** A race must have at least two colonies with population or infrastructure to be eligible for civilian mining.

**Probability Check:** Each construction phase, the system rolls 1-50,000 against:

**Annual Wealth x (Construction Phase Seconds / Year Seconds)**

For example, a race with 20,000 wealth during a five-day construction cycle needs to roll under 274 (approximately 0.55% chance per cycle). Wealthier empires generate civilian mining colonies more frequently.

### Location Selection Criteria

Potential civilian mining sites must meet all of the following requirements:

- **Minimum Duranium:** At least 10,000 tons of Duranium present
- **Minimum Accessibility:** At least 0.7 accessibility rating
- **System Population:** Located in a system with a population of 10 million or more
- **Distance from Star:** Less than 80 AU from the parent star
- **Multi-Star Systems:** If orbiting a non-primary star, that star must be within 80 AU of the primary or connected via Lagrange Points

### Scoring and Selection

Each qualifying location receives a score based on:
- **Total minerals** with accessibility of 0.5 or higher
- **Duranium scores double** in the calculation
- The highest-scoring location receives the new mining complex

This scoring system ensures civilians prefer locations with both good accessibility AND valuable mineral diversity, with a bias toward Duranium-rich sites.

### Expansion of Existing Colonies

For each existing civilian mining colony, a similar probability check is made each construction phase to determine if an additional mining complex is added to that colony:
- The expansion roll is 1-100,000 (half the probability of new colony establishment)
- This allows established civilian mining sites to grow over time

### Key Design Differences from VB6

The C# civilian mining system is more location-agnostic than VB6:
- It prevents high-population systems from blocking better mining sites elsewhere
- The 10 million population threshold for system eligibility aligns with civilian destination mechanics

### Benefits of Civilian Mining

- **Free Mineral Income:** Minerals extracted by civilian mines cost you nothing to produce
- **No Workers Required:** Civilian Mining Complexes do not require workers to operate
- **Broader Coverage:** Civilians exploit deposits you may have overlooked
- **Automatic Transport:** Civilian freighters handle mineral transport from civilian mines
- **Empire Mining Tab:** Civilian mining production appears alongside government mining in the Economics window

### Limitations

- You cannot directly control where civilians choose to mine
- Civilian mining output is generally smaller than a dedicated government mining colony
- Civilians may not prioritise the minerals you most urgently need
- New colony probability is wealth-dependent -- poor empires generate fewer civilian mines
- Requires minimum infrastructure (10M+ population in the system, 10,000+ Duranium at 0.7+ accessibility)

> **Tip:** Civilian mining is a wealth-driven bonus that grows with your economy. The wealthier your empire, the more frequently new civilian mining colonies appear. Maintain good survey coverage and keep systems safe to maximise civilian mining opportunities. Since Duranium scores double in site selection, civilians will naturally gravitate toward your most structurally important mineral deposits.

## 6.5.3 Civilian Destinations

The civilian destination system determines where civilian shipping lines send population and trade goods. Understanding this system helps you guide civilian development.

### Population Threshold

In C# Aurora, the threshold for player control over civilian destinations has been lowered to **the lower of 10 million or half the system body's capacity** (down from 25 million in VB6).

### Automatic vs. Player-Controlled Destinations

**Below the threshold (automatic):**
- Populations function as automatic destinations requiring no player input
- Civilian shipping lines service these colonies without intervention
- All trade goods become available at the 10 million population level

**Above the threshold (player-controlled):**
- Players gain control over colony designation options:
  - **Destination for colonists:** The colony will receive civilian population transfers
  - **Source of colonists:** The colony will send population to other destinations
  - **Neither:** The colony is excluded from civilian population movement

### Design Rationale

The 10 million threshold was chosen to align with:
- The point at which civilians begin considering mining colony creation in the same system
- The expanded universe layout in C# Aurora, where populations develop more slowly due to altered jump point generation
- The original 25 million threshold was considered impractical for C# gameplay pacing

### Trade Goods

All trade goods become available once a population reaches 10 million (down from the previous threshold of 20 million for some trade good types). This creates a unified management point for civilian economic activity.

## 6.5.4 Managing Civilians

While the civilian economy operates autonomously, the player has several indirect tools to influence and benefit from civilian activity.

**Civilian Economy Controls:**

- **Commercial Shipyard Priority:** You can prioritize civilian construction orders at your commercial shipyards. Government orders can be set to take priority, or you can allow civilians to use excess capacity.
- **Subsidies:** In some cases, you can subsidize civilian shipping line construction to accelerate fleet growth.
- **Shipping Line Contracts:** Civilian shipping can be contracted for specific government tasks (troop transport, mineral hauling) at a wealth cost.

**Monitoring the Civilian Economy:**

The civilian economy status is visible in several game windows:
- **Civilian Shipping Lines:** Shows all active shipping lines, their fleet sizes, and current operations.
- **Civilian Trade Routes:** Displays active trade routes and their income.
- **Civilian Mining:** Lists active civilian mining colonies and their output.
- **Civilian Fleet:** Shows all civilian ships, their types, locations, and current orders.

**Protecting Civilian Assets:**

Civilian ships and colonies are vulnerable to attack. Player responsibilities include:
- Providing military escorts in potentially dangerous systems.
- Maintaining sensor coverage to detect threats before they reach trade lanes.
- Garrisoning systems with civilian mining colonies.
- Responding quickly to distress signals from civilian ships under attack.
- Clearing hostile forces from systems before civilian traffic resumes.

**Civilian Economy and Expansion:**

The civilian economy naturally supports expansion:
- When you establish a new colony, civilian shipping lines begin servicing it (assuming safe routes exist).
- As colonies grow, civilian trade income increases.
- Civilian population transport can supplement your colony ships.
- In mature empires, the civilian economy can handle the majority of inter-colony logistics, freeing your government ships for military purposes.

**Civilian Economy Pitfalls:**

- **Over-reliance:** Do not depend entirely on civilian logistics for critical military supply chains. Civilians may reroute away from dangerous areas precisely when you need supplies most.
- **Shipyard Competition:** Civilian orders at commercial shipyards compete with government orders. If you need a freighter urgently, civilian orders may delay it.
- **Vulnerability:** A single raider in a trade lane can devastate civilian shipping, cutting off colony supply lines. Maintain patrol coverage.
- **Uncontrollable Priorities:** Civilians optimise for profit, not for your strategic needs. They may ignore critical mineral shortages in favour of more profitable routes.

> **Tip:** The civilian economy is a powerful ally but an unreliable one in wartime. Maintain enough government logistical capacity to sustain critical operations independently of civilian trade. Use the civilian economy as a peacetime efficiency multiplier, not a strategic dependency.
