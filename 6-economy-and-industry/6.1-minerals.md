# 6.1 Minerals

Minerals are the fundamental resources of Aurora's economy. Every ship, installation, missile, and piece of infrastructure requires specific combinations of trans-newtonian (TN) minerals to produce. Understanding mineral availability, accessibility, and depletion is essential for long-term strategic planning. Mineral deposits are discovered through geological surveys (see [Section 17.1 Geological Survey](../17-exploration/17.1-geological-survey.md)).

## 6.1.1 Mineral Types

Aurora C# features eleven trans-newtonian minerals, each serving distinct roles in your empire's industry and military:

**Duranium** - The backbone structural material of your empire. Used in virtually every construction project including ship hulls, armour, ground installations, and infrastructure. Also consumed in the production of maintenance supplies. *(v2.7.1)* Duranium demand is constant and enormous; shortages here cripple your entire economy.

**Neutronium** - A dense, ultra-hard material used primarily in armour and defensive structures. Higher-tech armour requires increasing quantities. Also used in some ground force equipment and fortifications.

**Corbomite** - Used in advanced armour types, shields, and some defensive technologies. Also required for converting Conventional Factories to Financial Centres (20 Corbomite per conversion). Demand grows as you research improved defensive systems.

**Tritanium** - The primary material for weapons construction. Beam weapons, turrets, missile launchers, and railguns all consume Tritanium. Military build-ups require substantial stockpiles.

**Boronide** - Used in power generation components, reactors, and power plants. Also required for fuel refinery construction (fuel refineries consume Duranium and Boronide). *(v2.7.1)* Every ship with an engine needs reactor power, making Boronide essential for fleet expansion.

**Mercassium** - The sensor mineral. All active and passive sensor components, fire control systems, and electronic warfare equipment require Mercassium. Also used in research facilities and ship life support systems.

**Vendarite** - Used in fighter and small craft construction. Critical for carrier-based doctrines that rely on fighter wings. Also appears in some industrial installation costs.

**Sorium** - The fuel mineral. Sorium is refined into fuel (Sorium harvested from gas giants is processed into fuel directly). Essential for all ship movement. Sorium deposits on terrestrial bodies are mined like other minerals; gas giant harvesting is a separate process.

**Uridium** - Used in advanced electronics, sensors, and research installations. Demand increases as your technology base grows and you build more sophisticated systems.

**Corundium** - The principal mineral for building mines. Without Corundium, no new mines can be constructed, halting your ability to expand mineral extraction. Also used in missile and torpedo construction, and in buoy production. Corundium shortages are strategically crippling because they prevent mining expansion entirely.

**Gallicite** - The engine mineral. All ship engines (see [Section 8.3 Engines](../8-ship-design/8.3-engines.md)) require Gallicite, making it one of the most strategically important minerals. Also consumed in the production of maintenance supplies. *(v2.7.1)* Engine technology improvements often increase Gallicite demand per engine. Chronic Gallicite shortages are among the most common economic crises in Aurora.

### Mineral Usage Summary

| Mineral | Primary Uses |
|---------|-------------|
| Duranium | Hulls, armour, installations, infrastructure, maintenance supplies |
| Neutronium | Armour, defensive structures |
| Corbomite | Shields, advanced armour |
| Tritanium | Weapons, launchers, turrets |
| Boronide | Reactors, power plants, fuel refineries |
| Mercassium | Sensors, fire control, ECM, research facilities |
| Vendarite | Fighters, small craft, some industrial installations |
| Sorium | Fuel (refined), fuel harvesting |
| Uridium | Electronics, research labs |
| Corundium | Mines, missiles, torpedoes, buoys |
| Gallicite | Engines, maintenance supplies |

> **Tip:** In the early game, Duranium and Gallicite shortages are the most common bottlenecks. Prioritize geological surveys of nearby bodies and consider which mineral deposits to exploit first based on your strategic needs.

## 6.1.2 Accessibility

Every mineral deposit on a planetary body has two key values: the total quantity available (in tons) and its accessibility rating (a value from 0.1 to 1.0, displayed as a decimal).

**How Accessibility Works:**

The accessibility value acts as a direct multiplier on mining output. A deposit with accessibility 1.0 yields full output from each mine working it, while a deposit with accessibility 0.1 yields only 10% of normal output. This represents how close to the surface the deposit is and how easily it can be extracted.

At the base tech level, a conventional mine produces 10 tons per year. With accessibility:

- Accessibility 1.0: produces 10 tons/year
- Accessibility 0.5: produces 5 tons/year
- Accessibility 0.1: produces 1 ton/year

**Accessibility Does Not Change:** Once a deposit is surveyed, its accessibility remains constant for the life of the deposit. You cannot improve accessibility through technology or infrastructure.

**Strategic Implications:**

- A small deposit with high accessibility (e.g., 5,000 tons at 1.0) may be more immediately useful than a massive deposit with low accessibility (e.g., 500,000 tons at 0.1).
- Low-accessibility deposits require many more mines to achieve useful output rates, tying up industrial capacity.
- When choosing mining sites, consider both total quantity and accessibility together. The "effective yield" of a deposit equals quantity multiplied by accessibility for comparison purposes.

> **Tip:** The Economics window shows mineral deposits sorted by quantity. Pay close attention to the accessibility column -- a planet with large but low-accessibility deposits may not be worth colonizing early when higher-accessibility deposits exist elsewhere in your system.

## 6.1.3 Depletion

Mineral deposits are finite. Every ton extracted reduces the remaining quantity of the deposit. When a deposit reaches zero, it is exhausted and no more of that mineral can be mined from that body (unless another deposit is somehow created through game events).

**Depletion Mechanics:**

- Mining output is subtracted directly from the deposit quantity each production cycle (every 5-day increment the game processes).
- Accessibility remains constant even as the deposit depletes -- you get the same per-mine output rate until the deposit is completely exhausted.
- There is no "diminishing returns" effect as a deposit shrinks. A deposit of 100 tons at 0.8 accessibility mines at exactly the same rate per mine as a deposit of 1,000,000 tons at 0.8 accessibility.
- When a deposit is exhausted, mining of that mineral on that body stops immediately. Mines remain in place but produce nothing for that mineral.

**Monitoring Depletion:**

The Economics window and the Mining tab show current deposit sizes. It is wise to periodically check your main mining colonies to ensure critical minerals are not about to run out unexpectedly.

**Depletion Timeline Estimation:**

You can estimate how long a deposit will last by dividing the remaining quantity by your annual extraction rate:

Years remaining = Deposit quantity / (Number of mines x per-mine output x accessibility)

**Strategic Responses to Depletion:**

- Begin surveying new systems (see [Section 17.1 Geological Survey](../17-exploration/17.1-geological-survey.md)) well before deposits run out on your homeworld.
- Develop asteroid mining or remote colony mining infrastructure as backup sources.
- Consider stockpiling critical minerals if production exceeds current demand.
- Civilian mining colonies (see [Section 6.5 Civilian Economy](6.5-civilian-economy.md)) can supplement government mining operations.
- Mass drivers can transfer minerals from remote mining sites to your main industrial centres without requiring cargo ships.

> **Tip:** Earth typically starts with moderate mineral deposits. Many players find that aggressively surveying the home system and establishing mining colonies on mineral-rich moons or asteroids in the first few decades is critical for long-term economic health.

## 6.1.4 Mineral Survey Window

The Mineral Survey window provides a filterable view of all mineral-bearing bodies discovered through geological surveys (see [Section 17.1 Geological Survey](../17-exploration/17.1-geological-survey.md)). It is the primary tool for evaluating colonization and mining targets.

**Populating the Window:**

The window starts blank each time it is opened. Press the **Wide View** button to expand columns and populate the list. Only bodies with mineral deposits appear; bodies without minerals are excluded.

**Available Filters:**

- **Column Filters:** Set minimum quantity thresholds per mineral type (e.g., minimum 100 Duranium) to filter results. Each mineral column can be filtered independently by both **Amount** and **Accessibility**, allowing you to find bodies with, for example, at least 50,000 Duranium at accessibility 0.5 or higher. *(v2.7.1)*
- **Max CC (Colony Cost):** Check the box and set a value (default 10) to exclude bodies with colony cost above the threshold
- **OM Eligible:** Shows only bodies eligible for orbital mining, determined by body diameter. The flag appears as a column indicator for each body, allowing quick identification of orbital mining candidates without checking diameters manually. *(v2.7.1)* Eligibility can be expanded through the Maximum Orbital Mining Diameter technology (see [Section 6.2.3 Asteroid Mining](6.2-mining.md))
- **Gas Giants:** Include, exclude, or show only gas giants (useful for identifying Sorium harvesting candidates)
- **Asteroids:** Include, exclude, or show only asteroids
- **No Alien:** Exclude bodies controlled by alien races
- **HAB Column:** Colour-coded habitability rating for quick assessment
- **Survey Indicator:** Bodies display an "S" or "M" indicator -- "S" denotes a completed geological survey, while "M" indicates mineral deposits were detected via a less precise method (e.g., gravitational survey). Only "S" bodies have confirmed deposit quantities and accessibilities. *(v2.7.1)*

**Usage Notes:**

- Use the **Search** button to apply filters; do NOT press Enter (it does not trigger a search)
- Use **Clear Search** to remove all active filters
- Filters reset every time the window is opened
- By default, the list sorts by Duranium quantity

> **Tip:** Combine the Max CC filter with the OM Eligible flag to quickly identify low-cost orbital mining targets that do not require population support infrastructure.
