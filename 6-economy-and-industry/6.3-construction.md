# 6.3 Construction

Construction is the process of turning raw minerals into usable installations, components, and ships. Aurora C# has distinct construction systems for ground installations, ship components, ordnance, and fighters, each with its own facilities and queues.

## 6.3.1 Construction Factories

Construction factories are the primary ground-based production facility. They build all planetary installations, ground force equipment, and various other items.

**How They Work:**

Each construction factory contributes a set number of Build Points (BP) per year toward whatever is in the colony's construction queue. The base output is 10 BP per factory per year, improvable through technology research.

**Specifications:**

- Workers: 50,000 per factory
- Size: 25,000 tons (one standard cargo hold)
- Build Cost: 240 BP
- Base Output: 10 BP/year/factory (upgradeable via Construction Rate research)

**What Construction Factories Build:**

- All ground installations (mines, automated mines, research labs, fuel refineries, financial centres, infrastructure, mass drivers, terraforming installations, ground force training facilities, etc.)
- Fighters and small craft (FACs -- Fast Attack Craft)
- Ground force units and equipment
- Prefabricated PDCs (Planetary Defence Centres)
- Maintenance facilities
- Various other colonial infrastructure

**Technology Improvements:**

The "Construction Rate" technology in the Construction and Production category increases factory output:
- Each tech level raises the BP per factory per year
- This is one of the highest-impact early research priorities since it accelerates all ground-based production

**Build Point Costs:**

Every item has a BP cost representing how much industrial effort is required to produce it. For example:
- Conventional Mine: 120 BP
- Automated Mine: 240 BP
- Research Lab: 2,400 BP
- Infrastructure: 2 BP per unit
- Construction Factory: 240 BP

**Mineral Requirements:**

In addition to BP costs, every item requires specific minerals. These are consumed as the item is built, drawn from the colony's mineral stockpile. If a required mineral runs out mid-construction, building pauses until more is available.

**Workforce:**

Construction factories require population to operate. Each factory needs workers drawn from the colony's population. A colony with insufficient population cannot run all its factories at full capacity.

> **Tip:** Construction factories building more construction factories is the fundamental economic growth loop in Aurora. In the early game, dedicating a significant portion of your construction queue to building additional factories (and mines to feed them) creates compound growth that pays dividends for decades.

## 6.3.2 Build Queue

The build queue (managed through the Economics window's Industry tab) determines what your construction factories produce and in what order.

**Queue Management:**

- Items are built in order from top to bottom.
- You can queue multiple items, each with a specified quantity.
- Production continues 24/7 -- factories never idle if the queue has items and minerals are available.
- You can pause, reorder, or cancel queue items at any time.
- Partially-completed items retain their progress if paused.

**Queue Controls:**

- **Add Item:** Select an item type and quantity, then add it to the queue.
- **Priority:** Move items up or down the queue to change build order.
- **Pause/Resume:** Temporarily halt production of a specific item without removing it.
- **Cancel:** Remove an item from the queue entirely (minerals already consumed are not refunded).
- **Repeat:** Set an item to automatically re-queue when complete (useful for continuous mine or factory production).

**Percentage Allocation:**

You can split your construction capacity across multiple queue items simultaneously by assigning percentage allocations. For example, you might allocate 50% to mines, 30% to factories, and 20% to infrastructure. Each allocation receives its proportional share of total BP output.

**Unused Capacity Display:**

When the total capacity devoted to industrial projects is less than 100%, the unused capacity is displayed alongside active production items. The system tracks unused capacity separately for three distinct production types:

- **Construction** -- Standard factory and installation projects
- **Ordnance** -- Missile and ammunition manufacturing
- **Fighters** -- Fighter craft production

This provides visibility into industrial inefficiency, helping players identify available production resources not currently allocated to active projects. If you see unused capacity in any category, consider adding queue items to maximise your industrial throughput.

**Completion and Delivery:**

- Ground installations are immediately available on the colony where they are built.
- Items built for transport (e.g., automated mines destined for another body) are placed in the colony's stockpile and must be loaded onto ships manually.
- Fighters and FACs appear in the colony's orbit upon completion.

**Common Queue Strategies:**

- **Early Game:** Factories (to compound growth) > Mines > Research Labs > Infrastructure
- **Expansion Phase:** Automated mines, freighters (via shipyard), mass drivers
- **Military Buildup:** Ordnance factories, fighter factories, ground force training

> **Tip:** The "Repeat" function is extremely useful for items you always want more of. Set mines or infrastructure to repeat and they will be continuously produced whenever your factories have spare capacity.

## 6.3.3 Naval Shipyards vs Commercial

Ships in Aurora are built in orbital shipyards, not construction factories. There are two types of shipyards, each with distinct capabilities and limitations.

**Naval Shipyards:**

Naval shipyards build military vessels -- warships, escorts, carriers, scouts, and any ship with exclusively military components.

- Can build ships with any military components (weapons, military sensors, armour beyond civilian standards, etc.)
- Generally smaller capacity (measured in tons) than commercial shipyards, though they can be expanded
- More expensive to build and expand
- Can be retooled to build different ship classes (retooling takes time proportional to the difference in tonnage between old and new class)
- Each shipyard has one or more slipways -- each slipway can build one ship at a time
- Adding slipways increases parallel production but each slipway addition takes time and resources

**Commercial Shipyards:**

Commercial shipyards build civilian and support vessels -- freighters, colony ships, fuel tankers, terraformers, survey ships, and other non-combat vessels.

- Cannot build ships with restricted military components (beam weapons, missile launchers, military-grade sensors, etc.)
- Typically have larger capacity than naval shipyards
- Cheaper and faster to build and expand
- Can build ships with commercial engines (which are larger but cheaper than military engines)
- Ideal for the large, slow vessels that form your logistical backbone

**Shipyard Operations:**

Both shipyard types share these mechanics:

- **Capacity:** Each shipyard has a maximum tonnage it can build. Ships larger than the yard's capacity cannot be built there. Capacity can be expanded through yard modifications.
- **Slipways:** Each slipway builds one ship at a time. More slipways = more simultaneous production. Adding slipways is a yard modification.
- **Retooling:** Changing which ship class a yard builds requires retooling time. Retooling from a 5,000-ton class to a 5,500-ton class is fast; retooling from 5,000 to 50,000 tons takes much longer.
- **Build Rate:** Shipyard output is measured in BP/year, similar to construction factories. The base rate is 400 BP per slipway per year (modifiable by technology).
- **Refits:** Shipyards can refit existing ships to a new design, consuming only the minerals for the changed components (much cheaper than building from scratch if the changes are minor).

**Commercial Ship Rules:**

Ships built at commercial shipyards must adhere to specific restrictions:
- No military components (weapons, military sensors, military-grade armour)
- Minimum 3-month deployment time
- Minimum 50 tons of Engineering Spaces
- Must use commercial engines (which provide 10x the size capacity of military engines for the same cost)
- Commercial ships do NOT suffer maintenance failures, making them inherently more reliable for long-duration logistics operations

**Shipyard Construction:**

Shipyards themselves are built by other shipyards (there is a "build shipyard" task) or can be part of your starting assets. Building a new shipyard is a major investment that takes years.

**Expanding Shipyard Capacity:**

- **Add Slipway:** Adds a parallel production slot. Takes significant time.
- **Increase Capacity:** Raises the maximum tonnage the yard can handle. Required before building larger ship classes.
- **Retool:** Changes the yard to produce a different ship class.

**Key Differences Summary:**

| Feature | Naval Shipyard | Commercial Shipyard |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Military weapons | Yes | No |
| Military engines | Yes | Yes (but also commercial) |
| Commercial engines | No (military only) | Yes |
| Typical capacity | Smaller | Larger |
| Build cost | Higher | Lower |
| Primary use | Warships | Freighters, tankers, colony ships |

**Ordnance Factories:**

Separate from shipyards, ordnance factories produce missiles, torpedoes, mines, and buoys. These are ground installations built by construction factories and produce ordnance according to your designed missile types.

- Workers: 50,000 per factory
- Base Output: 10 BP/year/factory (upgradeable via research)

**Fighter Factories:**

Fighter factories are specialised installations that produce fighters and other small craft too small for shipyard construction. They function similarly to construction factories but are dedicated to fighter/FAC production.

- Workers: 50,000 per factory
- Base Output: 10 BP/year/factory (upgradeable via research)

**Conventional Industry:**

At game start, empires begin with conventional industry representing pre-TN (trans-newtonian) manufacturing capability. In C# Aurora, 1,000 conventional industry units convert to approximately 475 TN construction factories. Conventional industry gradually converts to TN industry as your civilisation advances.

## 6.3.4 Component Development Costs

Researching new ship components requires Research Points (RP), with the cost determined by the component's Build Point (BP) cost. In version 1.13.0, the development cost formulas were restructured to address inconsistencies between component types and reduce prohibitive research costs for large components.

**Current Formulas:**

**Most Ship Components** (Active Sensors, Beam Fire Controls, CIWS, Cloaks, EM Sensors, Engines, Fighter Pod Bays, Gauss Cannons, Jump Engines, Lasers, Magazines, Meson Cannons, Microwaves, Missile Fire Controls, Missile Launchers, Particle Beams, Plasma Carronades, Power Plants, Railguns, Shield Generators, STO Ground Units, Thermal Sensors, Turrets):

```
Development Cost (RP) = SQRT(Cost_in_BP * 5000)
```

**Missiles and Non-STO Ground Units:**

```
Development Cost (RP) = SQRT(Cost_in_BP * 25000)
```

**Breakeven Points** (where costs equal the previous version):
- Standard components: 50 BP cost
- Missiles: 2.5 BP cost
- Ground units: 10 BP cost

**Practical Impact:**
- Components costing less than the breakeven point are now MORE expensive to research
- Components costing more than the breakeven point are now LESS expensive to research
- Example: A 10 BP component increased from 100 RP to 224 RP
- Example: A 1,000 BP component decreased from 10,000 RP to 2,236 RP
- Example: A 250,000-capacity minimal armor static HQ reduced from 5,012 RP to 1,583 RP

The net effect is that small, cheap components cost slightly more to research, while large, expensive components (which were previously prohibitively expensive) become much more accessible. This allows NPRs to develop a wider range of combat-capable components and provides more granular balance control.

## 6.3.5 Repair Yards

Repair Yards are a specialized third shipyard type introduced in C# Aurora (v1.13.0), sitting alongside naval and commercial variants. They are dedicated to restoring damaged vessels rather than constructing new ones.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Begin with a baseline capacity of 10,000 tons
- Build cost: 1,200 BP per yard (reduced from 2,400 BP as of v2.0)
- Can repair any ship class without requiring retooling
- Cannot build new ships or perform refits
- Specialized for restoration of battle-damaged or accident-damaged vessels

**When to Use Repair Yards:**
- After combat engagements that damage multiple ships
- For ongoing fleet maintenance at forward bases
- When you need repair capacity without dedicating a construction shipyard to the task
- At frontier colonies where dedicated repair infrastructure is more practical than full shipyards

**Strategic Value:** Repair yards free up your naval and commercial shipyards to focus on new construction while providing dedicated repair capacity. Since they do not require retooling for specific classes, a single repair yard can service your entire fleet regardless of ship diversity.

> **Tip:** A common mistake is building only naval shipyards early on. You need commercial shipyards for freighters and colony ships, which are essential for expanding your empire. Plan to have at least one of each type operational in your first decade. Consider adding a repair yard once your fleet starts seeing combat or operating far from home.
