# 6.2 Mining

Mining is the process of extracting trans-newtonian minerals from planetary bodies and asteroids. Aurora C# provides several methods of mineral extraction, each suited to different situations and stages of development.

## 6.2.1 Conventional Mines

Conventional mines are the standard ground-based mining installation, operated by colonists on habitable (or infrastructure-supported) worlds.

**Base Output:**

Each conventional mine produces a base output of 10 tons per mineral per year, modified by the deposit's accessibility. This base rate can be improved through mining technology research in the Construction and Production research category.

**Technology Improvements:**

The "Mining Production" technology line increases the per-mine output:
- Base: 10 tons/year
- Each tech level increases output (e.g., improved mining output techs can raise this to 20, 40, or higher tons/year per mine)

The formula for mine output is:

Annual output per mine = Base mining rate x Accessibility x Number of mines

All mines on a body contribute proportionally to extracting every available mineral deposit on that body. You do not assign mines to specific minerals -- they extract all available minerals simultaneously, with output for each mineral determined by that deposit's accessibility.

**Construction:**

Conventional mines are built by Construction Factories (see Section 6.3). They require Duranium, Vendarite, and other minerals depending on your technology level. Mines can also be transported to other colonies via cargo ships.

**Requirements:**

- Conventional mines require population to operate. A colony must have sufficient population to staff its mines.
- Mines on bodies without breathable atmospheres require infrastructure to support the mining population.
- Mines can be built on any body with mineral deposits, including moons, asteroids (if colonized), and other planets.

> **Tip:** In the early game, building additional mines for Earth is one of the most impactful investments you can make. Each mine provides minerals for every deposit on the planet simultaneously, making the return on investment substantial.

## 6.2.2 Automated Mines

Automated mines function identically to conventional mines in terms of mineral extraction, but they do not require population to operate. This makes them ideal for mining bodies where establishing a full colony would be impractical.

**Key Differences from Conventional Mines:**

- No population required to operate
- Must be transported to the target body via cargo ship (they cannot be built in place unless the body has construction factories)
- Produce at the same base rate as conventional mines (modified by mining technology)
- Slightly more expensive to build than conventional mines

**Deployment:**

1. Build automated mines at a colony with construction factories.
2. Load them onto a freighter (they are treated as cargo installations).
3. Transport them to the target body.
4. Unload them -- they begin mining immediately upon deployment.

**Ideal Uses:**

- Bodies with no atmosphere or extreme conditions that would require massive infrastructure investment
- Asteroid colonies where population transport is impractical
- Remote systems where you want mineral extraction without the logistical overhead of a full colony
- Moons and dwarf planets with good mineral deposits but poor habitability

**Limitations:**

- Cannot be constructed on-site unless the body already has construction factories and population
- Transportation requires freighter capacity and time
- If the body has no population at all, there is no one to unload cargo -- you may need a small initial colony or use the "unload to body" order

> **Tip:** A common early-game strategy is to build a batch of 50-100 automated mines on Earth, then deploy them to a mineral-rich moon (like Luna or a Jovian moon) with a single freighter run. This provides a steady mineral income from day one without any colony infrastructure.

## 6.2.3 Asteroid Mining

Asteroids often contain valuable mineral deposits, sometimes with very high accessibility ratings. Mining asteroids requires either colonizing them or using specialised mining ships.

**Colonizing Asteroids:**

Small asteroids can be colonized like any other body. Deploy automated mines (since population support infrastructure is usually impractical for tiny bodies) and begin extraction. However, minerals must be transported away via cargo ships since asteroids lack the infrastructure for direct use.

**Mass Drivers:**

Mass drivers are installations that electromagnetically launch mineral packets to a designated receiving colony. They provide a zero-fuel-cost method of transferring minerals from a mining outpost to your industrial centres.

- Mass drivers launch minerals at a set rate per driver per year.
- The receiving colony must also have a mass driver installation to catch the incoming packets.
- Mass drivers work within a star system (not between systems).
- They require no fuel and no ships, making them extremely efficient for intra-system mineral transport.
- You designate the destination colony in the colony management screen.

**Mass Driver Setup:**

1. Build mass driver installations on both the mining colony and the receiving colony.
2. On the mining colony, set the destination to the receiving colony.
3. Minerals will be automatically launched as they are mined (up to the mass driver's capacity).

**Mining Ships (Asteroid Miners):**

In Aurora C#, you can design ships with mining modules that extract minerals from asteroids without establishing a colony. These ships:
- Use the "Asteroid Mining Module" ship component
- Orbit an asteroid and automatically extract minerals
- Store extracted minerals in their cargo holds
- Must periodically return to a colony to offload minerals (or transfer to a freighter)
- Are particularly useful for exploiting scattered asteroid deposits without permanent colonization

> **Tip:** Mass drivers are one of the most efficient investments in the game for intra-system logistics. A pair of mass drivers (one at each end) eliminates the need for an entire freighter fleet to move minerals from a mining colony.

## 6.2.4 Deep Space Mining

"Deep space mining" in Aurora refers to establishing mining operations on low-gravity bodies far from your homeworld -- typically moons of gas giants, Kuiper belt objects, or bodies in other star systems.

**Challenges of Remote Mining:**

- **Distance:** Bodies in the outer system or other star systems require significant travel time for cargo ships.
- **Habitability:** Most remote bodies have no atmosphere, extreme temperatures, or very low gravity, requiring infrastructure or automated mines.
- **Logistics:** Getting minerals back to your industrial centres requires either a dedicated freighter fleet or mass driver chains.
- **Defence:** Remote mining colonies may be vulnerable to alien attack with no nearby military assets.

**Gas Giant Sorium Harvesting:**

Gas giants cannot be mined conventionally, but they contain harvestable Sorium that can be processed into fuel. This uses specialised "Fuel Harvester" ship modules:

- Design a ship with Fuel Harvester modules and sufficient fuel storage.
- Assign the ship to orbit a gas giant with a harvesting order.
- The ship automatically harvests Sorium from the gas giant's atmosphere and converts it to fuel.
- Harvested fuel can be transferred to a fuel depot, other ships, or a colony.
- Fuel harvesting rate depends on the size and number of harvester modules, plus the gas giant's Sorium availability.

**Fuel Harvesting vs. Ground-Based Sorium Mining:**

- Fuel harvesters convert directly to usable fuel; ground-mined Sorium must be refined at a colony with fuel refineries.
- Gas giants typically have much larger Sorium quantities than terrestrial deposits.
- Harvester ships represent a significant upfront investment but provide fuel independence from ground-based infrastructure.

**Remote Colony Infrastructure:**

For permanent mining colonies on hostile bodies, you typically need:
- Infrastructure installations (to support population in non-habitable environments)
- Either conventional mines + population, or automated mines (no population needed)
- Mass drivers or regular freighter runs to transport minerals home
- Optionally, a fuel depot or fuel harvester support for refuelling transport ships

**Multi-System Mining Networks:**

As your empire expands to multiple star systems, establishing mining colonies in each system becomes important. Key considerations:
- Survey all bodies in a new system promptly to identify the best mineral deposits.
- Prioritize high-accessibility deposits even if they are smaller.
- Consider establishing a local construction capacity to build mines on-site rather than shipping them from the homeworld.
- Jump gate construction enables faster and more fuel-efficient transport of minerals between systems.

> **Tip:** When expanding to a new system, look for a body that combines good mineral deposits with reasonable habitability (or at least one that is cost-effective to support with infrastructure). This body can serve as your local industrial hub, receiving minerals from automated mines on less hospitable bodies in the same system via mass drivers.
