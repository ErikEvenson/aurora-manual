# 6.4 Wealth and Trade

Wealth in Aurora C# represents the financial resources of your empire. While minerals are the physical building blocks, wealth covers the economic services, administrative costs, and financial infrastructure that keep your civilisation running.

## 6.4.1 Wealth Generation

Wealth is generated primarily through population and financial centres, representing the economic output of your civilisation's service sector, commerce, and taxation.

**Population-Based Wealth:**

Every unit of population generates a small base amount of wealth per year, representing the general economic activity of your citizens. Larger populations generate more wealth passively.

**Financial Centres:**

Financial centres are ground installations that significantly boost wealth generation for a colony. They represent banks, stock exchanges, insurance companies, and other financial institutions.

- Each financial centre generates a set amount of wealth per year.
- Financial centres require population to staff them.
- They are built by construction factories like other ground installations.
- Stacking many financial centres on a high-population world is the most effective way to generate wealth.

**Wealth Generation Formula:**

Total wealth income = (Population wealth contribution) + (Financial centres x wealth per centre)

**Taxes and Tariffs:**

The tax rate affects wealth generation from population. Higher taxes generate more wealth but can negatively affect population morale and growth. The default tax rate is balanced for steady income without significant morale penalties.

- Tax rate is adjustable per colony.
- Very high tax rates reduce population growth and can trigger unrest.
- Very low tax rates boost morale and growth but reduce income.

> **Tip:** In the early game, building a few financial centres on Earth provides a comfortable wealth buffer. As your empire grows and expenses increase, you will need proportionally more financial infrastructure to maintain positive cash flow.

## 6.4.2 Wealth Consumption

Many activities and maintenance costs consume wealth each production cycle. Running a deficit (spending more wealth than you generate) will eventually deplete your reserves and can cause serious problems.

**Major Wealth Costs:**

- **Ship Maintenance:** Every active ship in your fleet costs wealth to maintain, representing crew salaries, consumables, and routine maintenance. Larger and more advanced ships cost more. This is typically the largest single wealth expense.
- **Installation Maintenance:** Ground installations have ongoing wealth maintenance costs, though these are generally smaller per-unit than ship costs.
- **Crew Training:** Training ground forces and replacing crew casualties costs wealth.
- **Terraforming:** Some terraforming operations consume wealth in addition to minerals.
- **Espionage and Intelligence:** Running intelligence operations against other races costs wealth.
- **Ordnance Production:** Missiles and other ordnance have wealth costs in addition to mineral costs.

**Maintenance Cost Reduction:**

- The "Reduced Maintenance" technology line reduces fleet maintenance costs by a percentage per tech level. This is a high-priority research topic for large fleets.
- Mothballing ships (placing them in reserve) significantly reduces their maintenance costs but makes them unavailable for immediate use.
- Scrapping obsolete ships eliminates their maintenance burden entirely and recovers some minerals.

**Wealth Deficit Consequences:**

If your wealth reserves reach zero and you are running a deficit:
- Fleet maintenance may not be fully paid, leading to reduced readiness.
- Construction and research may be impacted.
- Population morale can suffer.
- In extreme cases, ships may become inactive due to unpaid crews.

**Monitoring Wealth:**

The Economics window shows your current wealth reserves, income, and expenditure. The wealth line in the summary section shows your net income (positive or negative) per production cycle.

> **Tip:** Before embarking on a major shipbuilding programme, check your projected maintenance costs. A fleet of 50 destroyers might win battles, but if you cannot afford to maintain them, they will become liabilities rather than assets. Balance fleet size against your economic capacity.

## 6.4.3 Trade and Shipping Lines

Trade in Aurora C# operates through civilian shipping lines that autonomously transport goods between your colonies. This system generates wealth and moves resources without requiring direct player management.

**How Trade Works:**

- Civilian shipping lines form automatically as your empire grows (see Section 6.5 for details on the civilian economy).
- Trade routes are established between colonies with complementary needs.
- Trade income is generated based on the volume of goods moved and the distance between colonies.
- Longer trade routes generate more wealth per trip but require more ships and time.

**Trade Route Requirements:**

For trade to occur between two colonies:
- Both colonies must have population.
- There must be civilian shipping capacity available (civilian shipping lines must exist with ships).
- The colonies should have goods to trade (surplus minerals, fuel, or other resources).

**Player Influence on Trade:**

While civilian trade is largely autonomous, you can influence it:
- Building infrastructure on colonies makes them more attractive to civilian shipping.
- Ensuring safe trade routes (by providing military escorts in dangerous systems) encourages civilian traffic.
- Establishing new colonies creates new potential trade partners.
- Building spaceports increases the capacity for civilian trade at a colony.

**Trade Income:**

Trade income is added to your empire's wealth each production cycle. The amount depends on:
- Number of active civilian trade ships.
- Volume and value of goods being traded.
- Number and distance of trade routes.
- Colony development levels at each end of the route.

**Protecting Trade:**

Civilian ships are unarmed and vulnerable to hostile action. If alien races or hostile NPR (Non-Player Race) ships destroy civilian traders:
- Trade income decreases.
- Civilian shipping lines may reroute away from dangerous systems.
- New civilian ships take time to build and replace losses.
- Protecting trade lanes is a significant military responsibility as your empire expands.

> **Tip:** Trade income scales naturally with empire size. Focus on expanding your number of developed colonies rather than trying to micromanage trade routes. The civilian economy will efficiently exploit trade opportunities you create through colonisation and infrastructure development.
