# 14.3 Supply Ships

Supply ships are the logistical backbone of extended fleet operations in Aurora C#. They carry fuel, ordnance, maintenance supplies, and other consumables to keep combat fleets operational far from their home bases. A well-designed logistics train is the difference between a fleet that can sustain offensive operations and one that must constantly retreat to resupply.

## 14.3.1 Colliers and Tankers

The two primary types of supply ships are tankers (carrying fuel) and colliers (carrying ordnance). Each fills a distinct role in fleet logistics.

**Tankers**

Tankers carry excess fuel for distribution to other ships in their task group or to other task groups:

- **Fuel Tankage Component:** The dedicated ship component for carrying distributable fuel. This is distinct from the ship's own fuel tanks; fuel in tankage is explicitly for transfer to other vessels
- **Capacity:** Tanker capacity is determined by the number and size of fuel tankage components installed
- **Refueling Operations:** Tankers can transfer fuel to other ships through the task group orders system
- **Design Priority:** Tankers should prioritize fuel capacity, with just enough engine power and self-fuel for transit operations

**Colliers**

Colliers carry missile ordnance and other ammunition for resupply of combat ships:

- **Magazine Component:** Colliers use magazine capacity to store ordnance for distribution. This is the same component type used on combat ships for their own ammunition
- **Ordnance Transfer:** Colliers can transfer specific ordnance types to combat ships that have expended their ammunition
- **Ordnance Selection:** Colliers must be loaded with the correct ordnance types for the combat ships they support; a collier loaded with anti-ship missiles cannot resupply a point defense frigate that needs defensive missiles
- **Reload Time:** Transferring ordnance takes time; combat ships being rearmed are not immediately ready for action

**Combined Supply Ships**

Some players design combined logistics vessels that carry both fuel and ordnance:

- **Advantages:** Fewer ship classes to manage, a single vessel can provide both types of resupply
- **Disadvantages:** Less efficient per ton of hull than dedicated designs; if you need fuel but not ordnance (or vice versa), you are transporting unused capacity
- **Decision Point:** For small navies, combined ships reduce complexity. For large navies, dedicated tankers and colliers provide better efficiency

**Supply Ship Classes Example**

A typical logistics fleet might include:

| Ship Type | Primary Cargo | Typical Size | Role |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|------|
| Fleet Tanker | Fuel | 30,000-50,000 tons | Accompanies combat fleet |
| Station Tanker | Fuel | 50,000-100,000 tons | Shuttle runs between base and depot |
| Fleet Collier | Ordnance | 20,000-40,000 tons | Accompanies missile-heavy fleet |
| Supply Ship | Fuel + Ordnance + MSP | 40,000-60,000 tons | General purpose logistics |

**Practical Tips:**

- A missile-heavy fleet without collier support is a one-shot weapon; after the magazines are empty, your ships become expensive sensor platforms
- Tankers are needed by virtually every fleet; fuel consumption during combat maneuvering can be dramatic
- Load colliers with the specific ordnance types your combat ships use before departing; loading the wrong missiles is a surprisingly common error
- Consider the transit time between your supply base and operational area when determining how many supply ships you need; longer distances require more ships to maintain continuous supply

## 14.3.2 Supply Ship Design

Designing effective supply ships requires balancing capacity, speed, protection, and cost. A supply ship that cannot keep up with its fleet or that is destroyed at the first sign of combat provides no logistical value.

**Speed Considerations**

Supply ship speed relative to the combat fleet they support is a critical design parameter:

- **Fleet Speed Match:** If supply ships accompany the combat fleet, they must match fleet speed or they slow the entire formation
- **Convoy Speed:** Alternatively, supply ships can operate in separate, slower convoys that meet the combat fleet at predetermined points
- **Speed vs. Capacity Trade-off:** Faster engines consume hull space that could be used for cargo capacity. A 5,000 km/s tanker carries significantly more fuel than a 10,000 km/s tanker of the same tonnage
- **Recommendation:** For most navies, supply ships should be designed at 60-80% of combat fleet speed, operating in a logistics train that follows the combat force rather than integrating with it

**Protection**

Supply ships are high-value targets that must survive long enough to complete their mission:

- **Armor:** A single layer of armor provides protection against minor damage but adds significant mass. Consider the threat environment when deciding on armor levels
- **Shields:** Shields protect without permanent mass cost but require power generation capacity
- **Point Defense:** Minimal point defense capability can protect against missile attack during resupply operations
- **Escort:** The most effective protection for supply ships is dedicated escort vessels rather than self-defense capability
- **Signature:** Supply ships are typically large and have notable thermal/EM signatures; stealth is generally impractical

**Capacity Optimization**

Maximizing useful cargo capacity per ton of hull:

- **Minimize Combat Systems:** Supply ships should not carry offensive weapons; every ton of weapons is a ton of lost cargo capacity
- **Efficient Engines:** Use fuel-efficient (low power) engines rather than high-performance ones; supply ships rarely need to sprint
- **Engineering Spaces:** Include adequate engineering spaces for maintenance life, but do not over-allocate
- **Crew Quarters:** Minimum crew requirements only; supply ships do not need extra crew

**MSP Supply Ships**

Some designs carry Maintenance Supply Points rather than fuel or ordnance:

- **Maintenance Storage Component:** Provides MSP capacity for distribution to fleet ships
- **Use Case:** Fleets on extended deployments far from colonies benefit from MSP resupply
- **Combined Design:** MSP capacity can be included on tankers or colliers as a secondary capability

**Example Supply Ship Design Philosophy**

For a fleet operating 3-4 jump points from home:

1. **Speed:** 4,000-6,000 km/s (slower than combat fleet but fast enough for timely resupply)
2. **Fuel Capacity:** Enough to refuel the entire combat fleet at least once
3. **Ordnance:** Enough missiles for one full reload of all missile ships
4. **MSP:** Enough for 6 months of anticipated maintenance needs
5. **Protection:** One layer of armor, minimal shields
6. **Range:** Sufficient fuel for own transit plus reserve

**Practical Tips:**

- Design supply ships to be built in commercial shipyards if possible; commercial yards are typically larger and cheaper to operate, and supply ships do not require naval yard construction
- Build supply ships larger rather than smaller; the per-ton efficiency of logistics capacity improves with scale
- Include a small fuel reserve beyond what you plan to distribute; a tanker that runs out of its own fuel delivering cargo is useless
- Consider designing modular supply ships that can be quickly refitted between tanker and collier roles as needs change
- Your supply fleet should be sized to support your combat fleet's worst-case consumption; if your battle plan calls for three missile salvos, your colliers should carry three full reloads

## 14.3.3 Underway Replenishment

Underway replenishment (UNREP) is the process of resupplying ships while deployed, without requiring them to return to a colony or base. This capability is essential for sustained offensive operations and long-range deployments.

**UNREP Mechanics**

Underway replenishment in Aurora C# works through the task group order system:

- **Proximity Requirement:** The supply ship and receiving ship must be in the same location (orbit of the same body, or the same spatial coordinates)
- **Order Types:** Refuel from tanker, rearm from collier, resupply MSP
- **Transfer Rate:** Fuel and ordnance transfer occurs over time; the rate depends on the specific components involved
- **Automatic Resupply:** Task groups can be configured to automatically resupply from attached logistics vessels when supplies drop below a threshold

**Resupply Patterns**

Several common UNREP patterns are used by experienced players:

**1. Embedded Logistics**

Supply ships travel as part of the combat task group:

- Advantages: Always available, no coordination required
- Disadvantages: Supply ships slow the task group to their speed, and are present during combat (vulnerable)
- Best for: Defensive operations, patrol circuits

**2. Trailing Logistics Train**

Supply ships travel in a separate task group behind the combat fleet:

- Advantages: Combat fleet moves at full speed, supply ships not exposed to initial combat
- Disadvantages: Requires coordination, combat fleet may outrun its logistics
- Best for: Offensive operations, fleet advances into enemy territory

**3. Forward Depot Shuttle**

Supply ships make regular runs between a forward depot and the combat fleet:

- Advantages: Combat fleet never waits for supply ships, continuous resupply pipeline
- Disadvantages: Requires established forward depot, shuttle ships are vulnerable to interdiction
- Best for: Sustained operations in a fixed area, siege operations

**4. Rally Point Resupply**

Combat fleet and supply ships meet at predetermined points for resupply:

- Advantages: Supply ships avoid combat entirely, predictable scheduling
- Disadvantages: Rigid schedule, combat fleet must disengage to resupply
- Best for: Long-range raids, independent operations

**Refueling Considerations**

When conducting fuel UNREP:

- Ships refuel proportionally; each ship in the task group receives fuel based on its capacity relative to available fuel
- Monitor fuel levels after refueling to ensure all ships received adequate fuel
- Plan refueling intervals based on the most fuel-hungry ship in the task group
- A ship with 0% fuel is immobile; always refuel before reaching critical levels

**Rearming Considerations**

When conducting ordnance UNREP:

- The collier must carry the exact ordnance types needed by the receiving ships
- Ships reload their magazines to capacity if sufficient ordnance is available
- Rearming takes longer than refueling; plan for the time required
- Partially loaded magazines still provide combat capability; do not wait for full reload if the tactical situation demands immediate action

**Practical Tips:**

- Establish a fuel threshold for your combat task groups (e.g., refuel when any ship drops below 40%); do not wait until ships are nearly empty
- After a major missile engagement, immediately check ordnance levels and arrange resupply; a fleet without missiles is a fleet without its primary weapon
- When operating multiple task groups, designate one as the logistics coordinator to avoid duplicate resupply requests
- Practice your UNREP procedures during peacetime; working out the logistics before combat ensures smooth operations when it matters
- Protect your supply lines; an enemy that interdicts your logistics train can defeat your combat fleet without ever engaging it directly
- Consider the fuel cost of the UNREP itself; supply ships burn fuel too, and a tanker that uses half its cargo reaching the fleet is only half as useful
