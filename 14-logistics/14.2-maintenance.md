# 14.2 Maintenance

Every ship in Aurora C# accumulates wear over time, eventually leading to component failures if not properly maintained. The maintenance system creates a persistent logistical challenge that prevents indefinite deployments without support infrastructure, and rewards careful planning with reliable fleet operations.

## 14.2.1 Maintenance Clock

Each ship has an internal maintenance clock that tracks how long it has been since its last overhaul. As this clock advances, the probability of component failures increases, eventually making the ship unreliable or even dangerous to operate.

**How the Maintenance Clock Works**

- **Starting Point:** When a ship is first built or completes an overhaul, its maintenance clock resets to zero
- **Clock Advancement:** The clock advances in real time as the game progresses, regardless of whether the ship is moving, in orbit, or idle
- **Failure Probability:** As the clock advances past the ship's expected maintenance life, the probability of random component failures increases
- **Expected Maintenance Life:** Determined by the ship's Maintenance Life rating, which is a function of its components and overall design

**Maintenance Life**

A ship's Maintenance Life is displayed in the ship design window and represents the expected period before maintenance becomes critical:

- **Base Life:** Each component has a maintenance life contribution; the ship's overall maintenance life is calculated from these
- **Deployment Time:** The maintenance clock begins ticking from the moment the ship launches from the shipyard
- **Failure Curve:** The probability of failure is near zero early in the maintenance life, then increases gradually, eventually becoming near-certain for extended deployments beyond the rated life

**Component Failures**

When a maintenance failure occurs, a random component on the ship is damaged:

- **Random Selection:** The failed component is selected randomly from all components on the ship that are eligible for failure. As of v1.12.0, maintenance failures are only checked against components that can actually fail, preventing erroneous explosions on carriers and tankers from non-failing components such as hangars or fuel storage
- **Damage:** The component ceases to function until repaired
- **Critical Failures:** If engines fail, the ship is immobilized. If fuel tanks fail, fuel may be lost. Sensor failures blind the ship
- **Cascading Problems:** On long-overdue ships, multiple failures can occur in quick succession
- **Repair:** Failed components can be repaired using Maintenance Supply Points (MSP) if the ship has them available (see Section 14.2.2)
- **Damage Attribution (v2.4.0+):** Maintenance failure damage is correctly attributed as maintenance-related in the ship's event log, rather than being incorrectly reported as enemy action. This prevents false combat alerts when ships suffer routine wear failures.

**Factors Affecting Maintenance**

Several factors influence how quickly maintenance becomes a problem:

- **Ship Size:** Larger ships generally have longer maintenance lives due to redundancy
- **Component Quality:** Higher-technology components tend to have better maintenance characteristics
- **Engineering Spaces:** The engineering section of a ship (crew quarters, maintenance capacity) affects maintenance life
- **Deployment Pattern:** Ships in continuous operation accumulate maintenance time faster than ships periodically returned for overhaul

**Practical Tips:**

- Track your ships' maintenance status regularly; the fleet window shows current maintenance clock status as a percentage of rated life
- When a ship hits 100% of its maintenance life, failures become increasingly likely; plan to overhaul before this point
- Do not wait for failures before scheduling overhauls; the cost of a critical failure (especially engine or fuel tank) far exceeds the cost of preventive maintenance
- Long-range exploration ships (see [Section 17.1 Geological Survey](../17-exploration/17.1-geological-survey.md)) are particularly vulnerable to maintenance issues due to their extended deployments far from shipyards
- Consider maintenance life when designing ships; sometimes accepting slightly lower performance for better maintenance characteristics is worthwhile

## 14.2.2 Maintenance Facilities and Capacity

The C# Aurora maintenance system uses a tonnage-based capacity model. Maintenance facilities and modules work together at a single location to support all ships present.

### Maintenance Facility Basics

- **Size**: 25,000 tons (one standard cargo hold)
- **Cost**: 60 BP per facility
- **Materials**: 30 Duranium + 30 Neutronium
- **Workers**: 50,000 per facility
- **Basic Capacity**: Each maintenance facility or module has a basic capacity of 1,000 tons
- **Technology Progression**: Capacity upgrades across 9 tech tiers from 1,000 to 6,250 tons, with research costs from 1,000 RP to 250,000 RP
- **MSP Production**: Maintenance facilities are the only source of Maintenance Supply Points in C# Aurora (they can no longer be built with construction factories)
- **MSP Production Rates**: Base production of 80 MSP/year per facility, upgradeable across 10 tech levels to a maximum of 400 MSP/year (research costs from 3,000 RP to 1,200,000 RP)

### Maintenance Modules

Maintenance modules are ship-mounted components that provide mobile maintenance capacity. As of v2.0, maintenance modules cost **100 Build Points** (reduced from 200 BP). This cost reduction makes ship-based maintenance infrastructure more accessible for forward-deployed fleet support.

### Combined Maintenance Capacity

Multiple populations and maintenance ships of the same faction at one location combine their capacities into a Total Maintenance Capacity. This enables deep space bases with only maintenance modules and no planetary infrastructure.

### Effective Maintenance Rate (EMR)

When total ship tonnage exceeds maintenance capacity, the system calculates:

> EMR = Total Maintenance Capacity / Total Ship Tonnage

Each vessel then uses proportionally reduced MSP and experiences reduced maintenance failure chances at the same ratio.

**Example:** With 80,000 tons of maintenance capacity maintaining 100,000 tons of ships, the EMR is 80%. Each vessel consumes 80% of normal MSP, and maintenance failure chance is reduced by 80% (i.e., only 20% failure rate applies).

### Capacity Modifiers

Maintenance capacity receives adjustments based on:
- Population manufacturing efficiency
- Radiation production modifier
- Political stability and status modifiers
- Racial economic production modifier (debt-to-income ratio)

### MSP Requirements Per Ship

- **Normal Maintenance**: Ships require MSP equal to Class Cost / 4, adjusted by EMR percentage
- **Overhaul**: Ships require MSP equal to Class Cost, adjusted by EMR percentage

### Facility Design Notes

Despite the cost reduction to 60 BP, maintenance facilities retained their transport size, manning requirements, and target size. The increased demand for facilities (since you can no longer share facilities across ships without sufficient tonnage capacity) creates additional pressure on worker allocation through increased demands for shipyard workers and financial centers.

## 14.2.3 Maintenance Supply Points

Maintenance Supply Points (MSP) are the consumable resource used to repair component failures in the field. Ships carry MSP in their maintenance storage, and colonies stockpile MSP for their orbital assets.

**MSP Production**

Maintenance Supply Points are produced exclusively by maintenance facilities:

- **Sole Source**: Maintenance facilities are the only source of MSP; construction factories can no longer produce them
- **Base Production Rate:** 80 MSP per facility per year at starting technology
- **Technology Progression:** MSP production rate is upgradeable across 10 tech levels, from 80 MSP/year to 400 MSP/year per facility (research costs range from 3,000 RP to 1,200,000 RP)
- **Automatic Production:** MSP production is continuous as long as minerals are available

**MSP Mineral Requirements:**

MSP production consumes three minerals:

| Mineral | Amount per MSP |
|---------|---------------|
| Duranium | 0.1 tons |
| Gallicite | 0.1 tons |
| Uridium | 0.05 tons |

This streamlined formula (reduced from eight minerals in earlier versions) was based on analysis of the most common minerals used in ship components subject to maintenance. Duranium and Gallicite are roughly equivalent in usage, while Uridium represents approximately half that consumption level.

**Minimum Supply Level:** Ship classes can be configured with a minimum maintenance supply threshold, analogous to the minimum fuel level setting. Ships will not unload or transfer maintenance supplies below this level, ensuring operational reserves for contingencies. This provides explicit player control over supply logistics rather than relying on implicit percentage-based limitations.

**Ship MSP Storage**

Ships can carry MSP for field repairs:

- **Maintenance Storage:** Ships have a maintenance storage capacity determined by their design. The Engineering Spaces component provides MSP capacity
- **Loading MSP:** Ships load MSP from colony stockpiles when in orbit of a colony with available MSP
- **Automatic Repair:** When a component fails, the ship automatically uses MSP from its storage to repair the damage (if sufficient MSP are available)
- **Repair Time:** Repairs using MSP are not instantaneous; they take time based on the complexity of the failed component
- **MSP Depletion:** Each repair consumes MSP from the ship's storage. Extended deployments without resupply will eventually exhaust the ship's MSP reserves

**Colony MSP Stockpile**

Colonies maintain MSP reserves for their own use and to supply visiting ships:

- **Reserve Building:** Colonies accumulate MSP from their maintenance facilities over time
- **Ship Resupply:** Ships in orbit automatically replenish their MSP storage from the colony's reserves (up to their storage capacity)
- **Priority:** If colony MSP reserves are low, you may need to prioritize which ships receive resupply
- **Monitoring:** The colony economy screen shows current MSP stockpile and production rate

**Damage Control**

When MSP are unavailable for a failed component:

- The component remains non-functional until MSP become available (either from resupply or return to a colony)
- The ship operates with reduced capability (missing the function of the failed component)
- Additional failures compound the problem, potentially rendering the ship combat-ineffective
- In extreme cases, a ship with multiple unrepaired failures may need to be towed back for overhaul

**Practical Tips:**

- Always ensure ships have adequate MSP storage for their planned deployment length; running out of MSP far from home is a serious problem
- Build maintenance facilities at all major colonies; MSP production is relatively cheap and prevents crises
- Ships with longer maintenance lives still need MSP; they may not fail as often, but when they do, they still need supplies for repair
- Monitor fleet-wide MSP levels; if multiple ships are running low, it indicates your resupply logistics need attention
- Consider carrying a dedicated supply ship with MSP storage to accompany long-range task groups (see Section 14.3)
- Engineering spaces on ships serve double duty: they extend maintenance life and provide MSP storage capacity

## 14.2.4 Overhaul

Overhaul is the process of completely resetting a ship's maintenance clock by returning it to a shipyard for comprehensive refurbishment. This is the only way to fully restore a ship's maintenance status and prevent ongoing component failures.

**Overhaul Requirements**

To overhaul a ship, the following conditions must be met:

- **Shipyard:** The ship must be docked at a naval shipyard (not a commercial shipyard) with sufficient capacity for the ship's tonnage
- **Shipyard Size:** The shipyard must be large enough to accommodate the ship. A shipyard can only overhaul ships up to its maximum tonnage capacity
- **Time:** Overhaul takes time based on the ship's size and complexity. Larger ships take proportionally longer
- **Minerals:** Overhaul consumes minerals from the colony's stockpile, representing replacement parts and refurbishment materials
- **No Other Activity:** A shipyard slip performing an overhaul cannot simultaneously build or refit ships in that slip

**Overhaul Process**

1. **Return to Port:** Move the ship to orbit of a colony with an appropriately sized naval shipyard
2. **Dock the Ship:** Issue the order to dock the ship at the shipyard
3. **Begin Overhaul:** Select the overhaul option from the shipyard management window
4. **Wait:** The overhaul proceeds over time. Progress is shown in the shipyard window
5. **Completion:** When complete, the ship's maintenance clock resets to zero and all pending maintenance issues are resolved

**Overhaul Duration**

The time required for overhaul depends on:

- **Ship Tonnage:** Larger ships take longer to overhaul
- **Shipyard Capacity:** A shipyard with more slips can overhaul more ships simultaneously (one per slip)
- **Technology:** Research in shipyard operations can reduce overhaul times
- **Damage:** Ships with many failed components may take additional time as those are repaired during the overhaul

**Overhauls and Movement Orders**

During overhaul, any movement orders in the queue are ignored and the fleet remains stationary. Upon overhaul completion, the fleet begins following queued movement orders set to occur after the overhaul. This allows organized sequences such as: overhaul, transit, resupply, combat maneuvers. When the cycle orders flag is enabled, a completed overhaul order is added to the end of the queue, and the Repeat option works with order lists containing overhaul commands.

**Abandon Overhaul (Leave Overhaul)**

The Abandon Overhaul order (also referred to as "Leave Overhaul") allows ships undergoing maintenance to immediately return to operational status rather than waiting for the overhaul to complete. As of v2.1, this order can be issued at the fleet level, affecting all ships in a fleet simultaneously rather than requiring individual ship commands. This is useful in emergencies when hostile vessels are approaching and combat-ready ships are needed immediately.

Ships that abandon overhaul suffer severe performance penalties that gradually improve over 30 days. The ship receives an "Overhaul Factor" starting at 0.01 that increases linearly to 1.0 over thirty days.

**Performance impacts (all proportional to the Overhaul Factor):**

| Days Since Abandon | Overhaul Factor | Effective Performance |
|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| 0 | 0.01 | 1% |
| 6 | 0.20 | 20% |
| 15 | 0.50 | 50% |
| 30 | 1.00 | 100% |

The Overhaul Factor affects:
- **Weapon Chance to Hit** -- Reduced proportionally
- **Engine power** -- Decreased significantly
- **Maximum shield strength** -- Drops proportionally
- **Maintenance failure likelihood** -- Increased
- **Jump shock duration** -- Extended
- **Fleet training capability** -- Diminished

Ships in overhaul cannot move, fire weapons, launch missiles, or generate shields. The Abandon Overhaul order provides tactical flexibility with substantial trade-offs.

**Scheduling Overhauls**

Effective overhaul scheduling keeps your fleet combat-ready:

- **Rotation:** Cycle ships through overhaul in rotation so that you always have combat-ready vessels available
- **Timing:** Schedule overhauls before ships hit 100% maintenance life to avoid operating with failure-prone vessels
- **Planning Margin:** Allow a buffer in your scheduling; wartime demands may prevent timely overhauls
- **Fleet Size:** Your fleet should be large enough that ships in overhaul do not create critical capability gaps

**Overhaul vs. Field Repair**

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Minor component failure during deployment | Field repair with MSP |
| Ship approaching maintenance life limit | Schedule overhaul |
| Multiple failures, MSP exhausted | Emergency return for overhaul |
| Ship severely damaged in combat | Overhaul (also repairs combat damage) |
| Routine between-deployment servicing | Overhaul resets the clock |

**Practical Tips:**

- Plan your shipyard capacity to support regular overhauls; if all your slips are building new ships, you have no capacity for maintenance
- A useful rule of thumb: dedicate at least one shipyard slip per 4-6 active combat ships for overhaul rotation
- Overhaul also repairs all combat damage, so it serves double duty after battles
- Commercial shipyards cannot perform overhauls; you need naval shipyard capacity specifically
- Build shipyards at forward bases if your operational area is far from your home system; transiting ships back for overhaul wastes operational time
- Do not neglect overhauls during peacetime; a fleet that enters a war with deferred maintenance will suffer failures at the worst possible moments
- Track overhaul schedules for your entire fleet; a spreadsheet or notes can help manage this for large navies
