# 14.2 Maintenance

Every ship in Aurora C# accumulates wear over time, eventually leading to component failures if not properly maintained. The maintenance system creates a persistent logistical challenge that prevents indefinite deployments without support infrastructure, and rewards careful planning with reliable fleet operations.

## 14.2.1 Maintenance Clock

Each ship has an internal maintenance clock that tracks how long it has been since its last overhaul. As this clock advances, the probability of component failures increases, eventually making the ship unreliable or even dangerous to operate.

**How the Maintenance Clock Works**

- **Starting Point:** When a ship is first built or completes an overhaul, its maintenance clock resets to zero
- **Clock Advancement:** The clock advances in real time as the game progresses, regardless of whether the ship is moving, in orbit, or idle
- **Failure Probability:** As the clock advances past the ship's expected maintenance life, the probability of random component failures increases
- **Expected Maintenance Life:** Determined by the ship's Maintenance Life rating, which is a function of its components and overall design

**Maintenance Life**

A ship's Maintenance Life is displayed in the ship design window and represents the expected period before maintenance becomes critical:

- **Base Life:** Each component has a maintenance life contribution; the ship's overall maintenance life is calculated from these
- **Deployment Time:** The maintenance clock begins ticking from the moment the ship launches from the shipyard
- **Failure Curve:** The probability of failure is near zero early in the maintenance life, then increases gradually, eventually becoming near-certain for extended deployments beyond the rated life

**Component Failures**

When a maintenance failure occurs, a random component on the ship is damaged:

- **Random Selection:** The failed component is selected randomly from all components on the ship
- **Damage:** The component ceases to function until repaired
- **Critical Failures:** If engines fail, the ship is immobilized. If fuel tanks fail, fuel may be lost. Sensor failures blind the ship
- **Cascading Problems:** On long-overdue ships, multiple failures can occur in quick succession
- **Repair:** Failed components can be repaired using Maintenance Supply Points (MSP) if the ship has them available (see Section 14.2.2)

**Factors Affecting Maintenance**

Several factors influence how quickly maintenance becomes a problem:

- **Ship Size:** Larger ships generally have longer maintenance lives due to redundancy
- **Component Quality:** Higher-technology components tend to have better maintenance characteristics
- **Engineering Spaces:** The engineering section of a ship (crew quarters, maintenance capacity) affects maintenance life
- **Deployment Pattern:** Ships in continuous operation accumulate maintenance time faster than ships periodically returned for overhaul

**Practical Tips:**

- Track your ships' maintenance status regularly; the fleet window shows current maintenance clock status as a percentage of rated life
- When a ship hits 100% of its maintenance life, failures become increasingly likely; plan to overhaul before this point
- Do not wait for failures before scheduling overhauls; the cost of a critical failure (especially engine or fuel tank) far exceeds the cost of preventive maintenance
- Long-range exploration ships are particularly vulnerable to maintenance issues due to their extended deployments far from shipyards
- Consider maintenance life when designing ships; sometimes accepting slightly lower performance for better maintenance characteristics is worthwhile

## 14.2.2 Maintenance Supplies

Maintenance Supply Points (MSP) are the consumable resource used to repair component failures in the field. Ships carry MSP in their maintenance storage, and colonies stockpile MSP for their orbital assets.

**MSP Production**

Maintenance Supply Points are produced at colonies with appropriate infrastructure:

- **Maintenance Facilities:** Colonies can build maintenance facilities that produce MSP over time
- **Production Rate:** Each facility produces a set amount of MSP per year
- **Mineral Cost:** MSP production consumes various minerals from the colony stockpile (the specific minerals depend on what components need to be maintained)
- **Automatic Production:** MSP production is continuous as long as minerals are available

**Ship MSP Storage**

Ships can carry MSP for field repairs:

- **Maintenance Storage:** Ships have a maintenance storage capacity determined by their design. The Engineering Spaces component provides MSP capacity
- **Loading MSP:** Ships load MSP from colony stockpiles when in orbit of a colony with available MSP
- **Automatic Repair:** When a component fails, the ship automatically uses MSP from its storage to repair the damage (if sufficient MSP are available)
- **Repair Time:** Repairs using MSP are not instantaneous; they take time based on the complexity of the failed component
- **MSP Depletion:** Each repair consumes MSP from the ship's storage. Extended deployments without resupply will eventually exhaust the ship's MSP reserves

**Colony MSP Stockpile**

Colonies maintain MSP reserves for their own use and to supply visiting ships:

- **Reserve Building:** Colonies accumulate MSP from their maintenance facilities over time
- **Ship Resupply:** Ships in orbit automatically replenish their MSP storage from the colony's reserves (up to their storage capacity)
- **Priority:** If colony MSP reserves are low, you may need to prioritize which ships receive resupply
- **Monitoring:** The colony economy screen shows current MSP stockpile and production rate

**Damage Control**

When MSP are unavailable for a failed component:

- The component remains non-functional until MSP become available (either from resupply or return to a colony)
- The ship operates with reduced capability (missing the function of the failed component)
- Additional failures compound the problem, potentially rendering the ship combat-ineffective
- In extreme cases, a ship with multiple unrepaired failures may need to be towed back for overhaul

**Practical Tips:**

- Always ensure ships have adequate MSP storage for their planned deployment length; running out of MSP far from home is a serious problem
- Build maintenance facilities at all major colonies; MSP production is relatively cheap and prevents crises
- Ships with longer maintenance lives still need MSP; they may not fail as often, but when they do, they still need supplies for repair
- Monitor fleet-wide MSP levels; if multiple ships are running low, it indicates your resupply logistics need attention
- Consider carrying a dedicated supply ship with MSP storage to accompany long-range task groups (see Section 14.3)
- Engineering spaces on ships serve double duty: they extend maintenance life and provide MSP storage capacity

## 14.2.3 Overhaul

Overhaul is the process of completely resetting a ship's maintenance clock by returning it to a shipyard for comprehensive refurbishment. This is the only way to fully restore a ship's maintenance status and prevent ongoing component failures.

**Overhaul Requirements**

To overhaul a ship, the following conditions must be met:

- **Shipyard:** The ship must be docked at a naval shipyard (not a commercial shipyard) with sufficient capacity for the ship's tonnage
- **Shipyard Size:** The shipyard must be large enough to accommodate the ship. A shipyard can only overhaul ships up to its maximum tonnage capacity
- **Time:** Overhaul takes time based on the ship's size and complexity. Larger ships take proportionally longer
- **Minerals:** Overhaul consumes minerals from the colony's stockpile, representing replacement parts and refurbishment materials
- **No Other Activity:** A shipyard slip performing an overhaul cannot simultaneously build or refit ships in that slip

**Overhaul Process**

1. **Return to Port:** Move the ship to orbit of a colony with an appropriately sized naval shipyard
2. **Dock the Ship:** Issue the order to dock the ship at the shipyard
3. **Begin Overhaul:** Select the overhaul option from the shipyard management window
4. **Wait:** The overhaul proceeds over time. Progress is shown in the shipyard window
5. **Completion:** When complete, the ship's maintenance clock resets to zero and all pending maintenance issues are resolved

**Overhaul Duration**

The time required for overhaul depends on:

- **Ship Tonnage:** Larger ships take longer to overhaul
- **Shipyard Capacity:** A shipyard with more slips can overhaul more ships simultaneously (one per slip)
- **Technology:** Research in shipyard operations can reduce overhaul times
- **Damage:** Ships with many failed components may take additional time as those are repaired during the overhaul

**Scheduling Overhauls**

Effective overhaul scheduling keeps your fleet combat-ready:

- **Rotation:** Cycle ships through overhaul in rotation so that you always have combat-ready vessels available
- **Timing:** Schedule overhauls before ships hit 100% maintenance life to avoid operating with failure-prone vessels
- **Planning Margin:** Allow a buffer in your scheduling; wartime demands may prevent timely overhauls
- **Fleet Size:** Your fleet should be large enough that ships in overhaul do not create critical capability gaps

**Overhaul vs. Field Repair**

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Minor component failure during deployment | Field repair with MSP |
| Ship approaching maintenance life limit | Schedule overhaul |
| Multiple failures, MSP exhausted | Emergency return for overhaul |
| Ship severely damaged in combat | Overhaul (also repairs combat damage) |
| Routine between-deployment servicing | Overhaul resets the clock |

**Practical Tips:**

- Plan your shipyard capacity to support regular overhauls; if all your slips are building new ships, you have no capacity for maintenance
- A useful rule of thumb: dedicate at least one shipyard slip per 4-6 active combat ships for overhaul rotation
- Overhaul also repairs all combat damage, so it serves double duty after battles
- Commercial shipyards cannot perform overhauls; you need naval shipyard capacity specifically
- Build shipyards at forward bases if your operational area is far from your home system; transiting ships back for overhaul wastes operational time
- Do not neglect overhauls during peacetime; a fleet that enters a war with deferred maintenance will suffer failures at the worst possible moments
- Track overhaul schedules for your entire fleet; a spreadsheet or notes can help manage this for large navies
