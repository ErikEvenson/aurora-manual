# 14.4 Orbital Habitats

Orbital habitats are space-based installations that serve a variety of purposes in Aurora C#, from research stations and defensive platforms to population centers and logistics hubs. Unlike ships, habitats remain stationary at their assigned location and function as extensions of your colonial infrastructure without requiring a habitable planetary body.

## 14.4.1 Habitat Types

Aurora C# provides several categories of orbital installations, each serving different strategic needs.

**Space Stations**

In C# Aurora, Space Stations are defined by their structural design: any ship class featuring a **Structural Shell** instead of standard armour is classified as a Space Station. This has several important mechanical implications:

- **Civilian Construction:** Space Stations can be built by civilian construction factories at any population with a Spaceport, rather than requiring shipyard construction
- **No Engines:** Space Stations cannot have engines and must be towed to their destination
- **No Military Systems:** Space Stations cannot mount weapons or military-grade sensors
- **Structural Shell Properties:** The shell provides 1 armour per unit with a strength of 20, essentially 5% the cost of normal armour. Critically, the structural shell does not prevent damage -- weapon fire passes straight through
- **Fleet Support:** Despite vulnerability, stations serve as refuelling points, maintenance depots, and staging areas
- **Location Flexibility:** Stations can be placed in orbit of any body or at a Lagrange point within a system

**Orbital Defense Platforms**

Purpose-built for system defense, orbital defense platforms provide static firepower at strategic locations:

- **Weapons:** Platforms can mount beam weapons (see [Section 12.2 Beam Weapons](../12-combat/12.2-beam-weapons.md)), missile launchers, and point defense systems
- **Sensors:** Platforms can carry passive and active sensors for detection coverage
- **Armor/Shields:** Defense platforms can be heavily armored since they do not need to allocate tonnage to engines
- **No Mobility:** Platforms cannot move once placed; they defend their fixed position
- **Cost Efficiency:** Without engines or fuel, platforms provide more firepower per ton than equivalent warships

**Research Stations**

Dedicated orbital facilities optimized for scientific research:

- **Research Labs:** Stations can host research laboratories that function identically to those on planets
- **Specialized Research:** Some players build research stations in systems with conditions beneficial to specific research areas
- **Population:** Research stations still require population to staff the laboratories
- **Remote Research:** Research stations allow you to conduct research in systems without habitable worlds

**Commercial Stations**

Orbital facilities that support civilian economic activity:

- **Civilian Shipping Hub:** Stations can serve as waypoints for civilian shipping lines
- **Trading Post:** Stations with appropriate population and infrastructure attract commercial activity
- **Mining Hub:** Stations placed near asteroid fields can serve as collection points for automated mining operations

**Listening Posts**

Small orbital installations focused on sensor coverage:

- **Passive Sensors:** Hosting thermal and EM sensors (see [Section 11.2 Passive Sensors](../11-sensors-and-detection/11.2-passive-sensors.md)) to provide early warning
- **Active Sensors:** Can mount active search sensors for detection of stealthy contacts
- **Minimal Population:** Require only a small crew to operate
- **Strategic Placement:** Positioned at jump points, system edges, or other locations requiring persistent sensor coverage

**Practical Tips:**

- Orbital defense platforms are extremely cost-effective for defending jump points; they provide heavy firepower without the ongoing fuel and maintenance costs of warships
- Research stations in systems with no habitable worlds let you exploit those systems' resources without terraforming investment
- Space stations at jump points serve as natural refueling and maintenance stops for fleets transiting through the system
- Listening posts at all jump points in your territory provide comprehensive early warning of hostile incursions

## 14.4.2 Construction

Building orbital habitats in C# Aurora follows a distinct process depending on the type of platform being constructed.

### Space Station Construction (Structural Shell)

Space Stations (those using Structural Shells instead of armour) have a unique construction pathway:

- **Civilian Construction:** Can be built by civilian construction factories at any population with a Spaceport
- **No Shipyard Required:** Unlike armed platforms, Space Stations do not need shipyard slipways
- **Design Phase:** Still designed in the ship design window, but must use Structural Shell instead of armour
- **Restrictions:** Cannot include engines or military systems (weapons, military sensors)

### Armed Platform Construction (Shipyard-Built)

Orbital defense platforms and other armed installations are built in shipyards:

- **Shipyard Type:** Both naval and commercial shipyards can build armed platforms
- **Design Phase:** Designed in the ship design window using standard armour and military components
- **Construction Time:** Build time depends on the platform's total tonnage and the shipyard's build rate
- **Slipway Capacity:** The shipyard must have a slipway large enough to accommodate the platform's tonnage

### Orbital Habitat Modules (Ark Modules)

Orbital habitat modules (called Ark Modules in C# Aurora, replacing VB6's Orbital Habitat Modules) provide population capacity in space:

- **Population Capacity:** Each habitat module supports **200,000 population** (increased from 50,000 in VB6)
- **Multiple Modules:** Multiple modules can be stacked on a single station for larger population capacity
- **Example:** A million-colonist facility costs approximately 1,145 Build Points
- **Cost Efficiency:** Significantly cheaper than ground-based infrastructure for comparable populations on high colony cost worlds
- **No Infrastructure Required:** Orbital populations do not require environmental protection infrastructure -- they live within the module itself

**Worker Distribution:**

Orbital populations follow a fixed 0/70/30 worker ratio: no agricultural workers, 70% in service industries, and 30% in manufacturing. This provides approximately 20% more manufacturing workers compared to equivalent surface populations (which allocate some workers to agriculture). This makes orbital habitats particularly efficient for industrial output.

**Population Growth:**

Orbital-based populations do not count toward the body's surface population capacity and do not receive natural population growth benefits. Only surface-based populations grow naturally on colonies. This means orbital populations must be actively supplemented via colonist transport if growth is desired.

**Loading:**

Ark Modules load colonists similarly to colony ships. Cargo shuttle bays significantly accelerate the loading process. While they can transport colonists like cryogenic transports, they are extremely inefficient for this purpose due to their enormous size -- they are best constructed into space stations and transported via tugs rather than used as colony ships.

### Design Components

When designing an orbital habitat or platform, consider the following components:

- **Hull:** The base structure providing tonnage capacity
- **Structural Shell (Space Stations):** Lightweight, inexpensive, but provides no protection. Cannot be combined with military systems
- **Standard Armour (Armed Platforms):** Provides real protection; since platforms have no speed penalty from armour, heavy armour is practical
- **Habitat Modules:** Each supports 200,000 population
- **Crew Quarters/Life Support:** Required for permanent personnel
- **Weapons (armed platforms only):** Beam weapons, missile launchers, point defense
- **Sensors (armed platforms only):** Active and passive sensors for detection roles
- **Maintenance Storage:** MSP capacity for self-repair
- **Fuel Storage:** If the habitat is intended to serve as a refuelling point
- **Cargo/Magazine:** For logistics hubs storing supplies or ordnance
- **Hangars:** For small craft servicing and storage
- **Maintenance Modules:** For supporting ship overhauls

**Deployment**

Once constructed, habitats must be moved to their intended location:

- **Towing:** Space Stations (Structural Shell designs) cannot have engines and must always be towed to their destination
- **Armed Platforms:** Can optionally be designed with engines for self-transit, though this adds significant cost and reduces combat tonnage
- **In-System Placement:** For habitats that will remain in the same system as construction, towing distance is minimal
- **Cross-System Deployment:** Moving habitats through jump points to distant systems requires planning for the towing transit time
- **Defence During Transit:** Stations being towed are extremely vulnerable; plan escorts for cross-system deployments

**Expansion and Upgrades**

Habitats can be expanded or modified after deployment:

- **Refit:** Like ships, habitats can be refitted at shipyards to change their component loadout
- **Additional Modules:** Some habitat designs allow for modular expansion by building additional sections
- **Obsolescence:** As technology advances, older habitats may need refits to remain effective (especially defense platforms)

**Construction Planning**

When planning orbital infrastructure:

1. **Identify Need:** Determine what function the habitat will serve (defense, logistics, research, population, etc.)
2. **Choose Construction Method:**
   - Space Station (Structural Shell): Built by civilian construction at any Spaceport -- no shipyard needed
   - Armed Platform: Requires shipyard with appropriate slipway capacity
3. **Design:** Create a design optimised for function. Remember: Structural Shell = no weapons/engines
4. **Towing Assets:** All Space Stations require towing; plan tug ships for deployment
5. **Population:** Each habitat module supports 200,000 population; plan colonist transport
6. **Defence:** Space Stations are extremely vulnerable; plan defensive coverage at destination
7. **Maintenance:** Plan for ongoing MSP needs and periodic overhaul

**Practical Tips:**

- Space Stations built at Spaceports via civilian construction free up your shipyard capacity for warships
- Design defense platforms without engines to maximise their combat tonnage; they should not need to move once placed
- A fleet base with Structural Shell can include hangars, maintenance modules, fuel storage, and ordnance transfer without needing a military shipyard
- Orbital habitats with 5 habitat modules (1 million population capacity) cost approximately 1,145 BP -- far cheaper than equivalent planetary infrastructure on high colony cost worlds
- Build habitats at the location closest to their intended deployment to minimise towing time
- Plan your shipyard capacity carefully; building a massive space station ties up a slipway for an extended period, potentially delaying critical ship construction
- Consider building habitats in phases: a basic station first, then refitting with additional capability as resources allow

## 14.4.3 Uses

Orbital habitats provide strategic flexibility that purely planetary colonies cannot match. This section covers the major applications of orbital infrastructure and how to integrate them into your empire's strategy.

**System Defense**

Orbital defense platforms form the backbone of static system defense:

- **Jump Point Defense:** Platforms positioned at jump points engage hostile contacts as they transit into the system, before they can scatter and complicate interception
- **Layered Defense:** Multiple platforms at different positions create overlapping fields of fire
- **Missile Defense:** Platforms with missile launchers can engage at long range, supplementing or replacing mobile fleet defense
- **Point Defense Umbrella:** Platforms with dedicated point defense protect nearby ships and other installations from missile attack
- **Planetary Defense:** Platforms in low orbit provide additional defense for colonies below
- **Cost Advantage:** A defense platform provides equivalent firepower to a warship at roughly half the total cost, since it needs no engines, minimal fuel, and has lower maintenance requirements

**Logistics Hub**

Stations serve as critical logistics nodes for fleet operations:

- **Fuel Depot:** Stations with fuel storage provide refueling capability at locations without colonies
- **Ordnance Storage:** Stations can store ordnance reserves closer to the operational area than your home colonies
- **MSP Distribution:** Maintenance supply storage on stations allows field resupply without returning to a colony
- **Crew Rest:** Stations can provide crew rest and rotation for long-deployed fleet elements
- **Repair:** Stations with shipyard facilities can perform emergency repairs or even overhauls away from the home system

**Research and Development**

Orbital research stations offer unique advantages:

- **Location Independence:** Conduct research in any system, regardless of planetary habitability
- **Concentration:** A dedicated research station can host many laboratories in a small footprint
- **Security:** Research stations can be placed in secure interior systems, protected from border threats
- **Specialized Environments:** Some research may benefit from specific orbital conditions

**Population and Economy**

Space stations with orbital habitat modules can support permanent populations:

- **Habitat Module Capacity:** Each orbital habitat module supports 200,000 population (increased from 50,000 in VB6 Aurora)
- **Cost Efficiency:** A million-colonist orbital habitat costs approximately 1,145 Build Points, making it cost-effective for:
  - High-gravity worlds unsuitable for ground colonies
  - Low-gravity environments where ground infrastructure is expensive
  - Deep space logistical operations with minimal real estate requirements
- **Industrial Capacity:** Stations can host factories, mines (for asteroids), and other economic installations
- **Independence:** Station populations contribute to the economy independently of planetary colonies
- **Growth:** Station populations can grow naturally, though typically slower than planetary populations
- **Alternative Colonisation:** Orbital habitats provide an alternative to planetary colonisation for inhospitable worlds or remote locations

**Sensor Coverage**

Orbital installations provide persistent surveillance:

- **Early Warning:** Sensors on stations and platforms provide continuous coverage without requiring ships to remain on station
- **Deep Space Monitoring:** Stations at system periphery can detect approaching threats at maximum range
- **Jump Point Surveillance:** Sensors at jump points detect all transiting contacts immediately
- **Reduced Fleet Burden:** Permanent sensor stations free up warships from picket duty

**Mining Operations**

Stations support space-based mining:

- **Asteroid Mining Hub:** Stations near asteroid fields serve as collection and processing points
- **Remote Extraction:** Allow mining operations in systems without habitable worlds
- **Fuel Support:** Stations near gas giants can support Sorium harvesting operations

**Strategic Applications**

| Application | Key Components | Typical Size |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Jump Point Defense | Weapons, sensors, armor, shields | 20,000-50,000 tons |
| Fuel Depot | Fuel storage, minimal crew | 10,000-30,000 tons |
| Logistics Hub | Fuel, ordnance, MSP storage | 30,000-60,000 tons |
| Research Station | Labs, crew quarters | 5,000-20,000 tons |
| Listening Post | Sensors, minimal crew | 1,000-5,000 tons |
| Population Station | Crew quarters, infrastructure | 50,000-200,000 tons |

**Practical Tips:**

- Defense platforms at jump points are your first line of defense; they engage enemies before hostile forces can disperse, maximizing their effectiveness
- A single logistics station at a forward jump point can extend your fleet's operational range by an entire system
- Do not over-invest in orbital infrastructure at the expense of mobile forces; platforms cannot reposition and are useless if the enemy bypasses them
- Research stations are particularly valuable early in the game when your home world's research capacity is limited
- Sensor stations at all your border jump points should be among your first orbital infrastructure investments; early warning is invaluable
- Consider placing defense platforms in depth rather than all at the border; if the enemy breaks through the first line, platforms deeper in your territory provide additional resistance
- Orbital infrastructure requires ongoing maintenance (MSP); do not build more stations than you can sustain
- Stations at asteroid fields can significantly boost your mining output, especially for minerals rare on your home world
