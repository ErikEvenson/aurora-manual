# 14.4 Orbital Habitats

Orbital habitats are space-based installations that serve a variety of purposes in Aurora C#, from research stations and defensive platforms to population centers and logistics hubs. Unlike ships, habitats remain stationary at their assigned location and function as extensions of your colonial infrastructure without requiring a habitable planetary body.

## 14.4.1 Habitat Types

Aurora C# provides several categories of orbital installations, each serving different strategic needs.

**Space Stations**

Space stations are general-purpose orbital habitats that can house population, installations, and serve as fleet support facilities:

- **Population Capacity:** Stations can support a resident population that contributes to the economy
- **Installation Hosting:** Most ground installations (factories, research labs, mines) can operate on a station just as they would on a planet
- **Fleet Support:** Stations can serve as refueling points, maintenance depots, and staging areas for fleet operations
- **Location Flexibility:** Stations can be placed in orbit of any body or at a lagrange point within a system

**Orbital Defense Platforms**

Purpose-built for system defense, orbital defense platforms provide static firepower at strategic locations:

- **Weapons:** Platforms can mount beam weapons, missile launchers, and point defense systems
- **Sensors:** Platforms can carry passive and active sensors for detection coverage
- **Armor/Shields:** Defense platforms can be heavily armored since they do not need to allocate tonnage to engines
- **No Mobility:** Platforms cannot move once placed; they defend their fixed position
- **Cost Efficiency:** Without engines or fuel, platforms provide more firepower per ton than equivalent warships

**Research Stations**

Dedicated orbital facilities optimized for scientific research:

- **Research Labs:** Stations can host research laboratories that function identically to those on planets
- **Specialized Research:** Some players build research stations in systems with conditions beneficial to specific research areas
- **Population:** Research stations still require population to staff the laboratories
- **Remote Research:** Research stations allow you to conduct research in systems without habitable worlds

**Commercial Stations**

Orbital facilities that support civilian economic activity:

- **Civilian Shipping Hub:** Stations can serve as waypoints for civilian shipping lines
- **Trading Post:** Stations with appropriate population and infrastructure attract commercial activity
- **Mining Hub:** Stations placed near asteroid fields can serve as collection points for automated mining operations

**Listening Posts**

Small orbital installations focused on sensor coverage:

- **Passive Sensors:** Hosting thermal and EM sensors to provide early warning
- **Active Sensors:** Can mount active search sensors for detection of stealthy contacts
- **Minimal Population:** Require only a small crew to operate
- **Strategic Placement:** Positioned at jump points, system edges, or other locations requiring persistent sensor coverage

**Practical Tips:**

- Orbital defense platforms are extremely cost-effective for defending jump points; they provide heavy firepower without the ongoing fuel and maintenance costs of warships
- Research stations in systems with no habitable worlds let you exploit those systems' resources without terraforming investment
- Space stations at jump points serve as natural refueling and maintenance stops for fleets transiting through the system
- Listening posts at all jump points in your territory provide comprehensive early warning of hostile incursions

## 14.4.2 Construction

Building orbital habitats follows a different process than building ships or ground installations. Understanding the construction pipeline is essential for planning your orbital infrastructure.

**Shipyard Construction**

Orbital habitats are built in shipyards, following the same general process as ship construction:

- **Shipyard Type:** Both naval and commercial shipyards can build orbital habitats
- **Design Phase:** Habitats are designed in the ship design window, using the same component system as ships (minus engines for stationary platforms)
- **Construction Time:** Build time depends on the habitat's total tonnage and the shipyard's build rate
- **Slipway Capacity:** The shipyard must have a slipway large enough to accommodate the habitat's tonnage

**Habitat Design Components**

When designing an orbital habitat, consider the following components:

- **Hull:** The base structure providing tonnage capacity for other components
- **Crew Quarters/Life Support:** Required for any habitat with permanent personnel
- **Armor:** Provides protection; since habitats have no speed penalty from armor, heavy armor is practical
- **Weapons (if applicable):** Beam weapons, missile launchers, point defense for combat stations
- **Sensors (if applicable):** Active and passive sensors for detection roles
- **Maintenance Storage:** MSP capacity for self-repair
- **Fuel Storage:** If the habitat is intended to serve as a refueling point
- **Cargo/Magazine:** For logistics hubs storing supplies or ordnance

**Deployment**

Once constructed, habitats must be moved to their intended location:

- **Towing:** Habitats without engines must be towed to their destination by ships equipped with tractor beams or towing capability
- **Self-Transit:** If designed with engines (unusual but possible), the habitat can transit under its own power, though this adds significant cost
- **In-System Placement:** For habitats that will remain in the same system as the shipyard, towing distance is minimal
- **Cross-System Deployment:** Moving habitats through jump points to distant systems requires planning for the towing transit time

**Expansion and Upgrades**

Habitats can be expanded or modified after deployment:

- **Refit:** Like ships, habitats can be refitted at shipyards to change their component loadout
- **Additional Modules:** Some habitat designs allow for modular expansion by building additional sections
- **Obsolescence:** As technology advances, older habitats may need refits to remain effective (especially defense platforms)

**Construction Planning**

When planning orbital infrastructure:

1. **Identify Need:** Determine what function the habitat will serve (defense, logistics, research, etc.)
2. **Design:** Create a habitat design optimized for that function
3. **Shipyard Allocation:** Ensure you have shipyard capacity available (not competing with ship construction)
4. **Towing Assets:** If the destination is not the construction system, plan towing ships
5. **Population:** Ensure you can staff the habitat with appropriate population levels
6. **Maintenance:** Plan for ongoing MSP needs and periodic overhaul

**Practical Tips:**

- Design defense platforms without engines to maximize their combat tonnage; they should not need to move once placed
- Build habitats at the shipyard closest to their intended deployment location to minimize towing time
- Commercial shipyards are often better for habitat construction since they tend to be larger and habitats do not usually require naval-grade construction
- Plan your shipyard capacity carefully; building a massive space station ties up a slipway for an extended period, potentially delaying critical ship construction
- Consider building habitats in phases: a basic station first, then refitting with additional capability as resources allow

## 14.4.3 Uses

Orbital habitats provide strategic flexibility that purely planetary colonies cannot match. This section covers the major applications of orbital infrastructure and how to integrate them into your empire's strategy.

**System Defense**

Orbital defense platforms form the backbone of static system defense:

- **Jump Point Defense:** Platforms positioned at jump points engage hostile contacts as they transit into the system, before they can scatter and complicate interception
- **Layered Defense:** Multiple platforms at different positions create overlapping fields of fire
- **Missile Defense:** Platforms with missile launchers can engage at long range, supplementing or replacing mobile fleet defense
- **Point Defense Umbrella:** Platforms with dedicated point defense protect nearby ships and other installations from missile attack
- **Planetary Defense:** Platforms in low orbit provide additional defense for colonies below
- **Cost Advantage:** A defense platform provides equivalent firepower to a warship at roughly half the total cost, since it needs no engines, minimal fuel, and has lower maintenance requirements

**Logistics Hub**

Stations serve as critical logistics nodes for fleet operations:

- **Fuel Depot:** Stations with fuel storage provide refueling capability at locations without colonies
- **Ordnance Storage:** Stations can store ordnance reserves closer to the operational area than your home colonies
- **MSP Distribution:** Maintenance supply storage on stations allows field resupply without returning to a colony
- **Crew Rest:** Stations can provide crew rest and rotation for long-deployed fleet elements
- **Repair:** Stations with shipyard facilities can perform emergency repairs or even overhauls away from the home system

**Research and Development**

Orbital research stations offer unique advantages:

- **Location Independence:** Conduct research in any system, regardless of planetary habitability
- **Concentration:** A dedicated research station can host many laboratories in a small footprint
- **Security:** Research stations can be placed in secure interior systems, protected from border threats
- **Specialized Environments:** Some research may benefit from specific orbital conditions

**Population and Economy**

Space stations can support permanent populations:

- **Overflow Population:** When planetary surfaces are full or unsuitable, stations provide additional population capacity
- **Industrial Capacity:** Stations can host factories, mines (for asteroids), and other economic installations
- **Independence:** Station populations contribute to the economy independently of planetary colonies
- **Growth:** Station populations can grow naturally, though typically slower than planetary populations

**Sensor Coverage**

Orbital installations provide persistent surveillance:

- **Early Warning:** Sensors on stations and platforms provide continuous coverage without requiring ships to remain on station
- **Deep Space Monitoring:** Stations at system periphery can detect approaching threats at maximum range
- **Jump Point Surveillance:** Sensors at jump points detect all transiting contacts immediately
- **Reduced Fleet Burden:** Permanent sensor stations free up warships from picket duty

**Mining Operations**

Stations support space-based mining:

- **Asteroid Mining Hub:** Stations near asteroid fields serve as collection and processing points
- **Remote Extraction:** Allow mining operations in systems without habitable worlds
- **Fuel Support:** Stations near gas giants can support Sorium harvesting operations

**Strategic Applications**

| Application | Key Components | Typical Size |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Jump Point Defense | Weapons, sensors, armor, shields | 20,000-50,000 tons |
| Fuel Depot | Fuel storage, minimal crew | 10,000-30,000 tons |
| Logistics Hub | Fuel, ordnance, MSP storage | 30,000-60,000 tons |
| Research Station | Labs, crew quarters | 5,000-20,000 tons |
| Listening Post | Sensors, minimal crew | 1,000-5,000 tons |
| Population Station | Crew quarters, infrastructure | 50,000-200,000 tons |

**Practical Tips:**

- Defense platforms at jump points are your first line of defense; they engage enemies before hostile forces can disperse, maximizing their effectiveness
- A single logistics station at a forward jump point can extend your fleet's operational range by an entire system
- Do not over-invest in orbital infrastructure at the expense of mobile forces; platforms cannot reposition and are useless if the enemy bypasses them
- Research stations are particularly valuable early in the game when your home world's research capacity is limited
- Sensor stations at all your border jump points should be among your first orbital infrastructure investments; early warning is invaluable
- Consider placing defense platforms in depth rather than all at the border; if the enemy breaks through the first line, platforms deeper in your territory provide additional resistance
- Orbital infrastructure requires ongoing maintenance (MSP); do not build more stations than you can sustain
- Stations at asteroid fields can significantly boost your mining output, especially for minerals rare on your home world
