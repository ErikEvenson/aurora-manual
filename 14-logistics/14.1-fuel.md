# 14.1 Fuel

Fuel is the lifeblood of any interstellar navy. Without it, ships cannot move, fleets cannot deploy, and your empire grinds to a halt. Fuel management is one of the most critical logistical challenges in Aurora C#, requiring careful attention to production capacity, consumption rates, and distribution across your colonies and fleets.

## 14.1.1 Sorium and Fuel Production

All ship fuel in Aurora is refined from Sorium, one of the eleven trans-newtonian minerals. Converting raw Sorium into usable fuel requires dedicated refinery installations on your colonies.

**Sorium as a Resource**

Sorium is found through geological surveys (see [Section 10.3 Survey Operations](../10-navigation/10.3-survey-operations.md)) on planets, moons, asteroids, and comets:

- **Planetary Deposits:** Most colonies will have some Sorium deposits, though accessibility and quantity vary widely
- **Gas Giant Harvesting:** Gas giants are a rich source of Sorium. Sorium Harvester modules on ships can extract Sorium directly from gas giant atmospheres, providing a renewable supply independent of mineral deposits
- **Asteroid Mining:** Asteroids may contain Sorium deposits that can be mined conventionally
- **Comets:** Comets occasionally contain significant Sorium deposits with high accessibility

**Fuel Refineries**

Fuel Refineries are the colony installation that converts raw Sorium into refined fuel:

- **Conversion Rate:** Each refinery converts a fixed amount of Sorium into fuel per year. The base rate is 40,000 litres of fuel per refinery per year at the starting technology level
- **Technology Improvement:** Researching fuel production technology increases the output per refinery across 11 tech levels, from 48,000 up to 280,000 litres/year
- **Mineral Consumption:** Each unit of fuel produced consumes a corresponding amount of Sorium from the colony's mineral stockpile
- **Build Cost:** Refineries are relatively cheap installations to construct, requiring modest amounts of Duranium and a small quantity of Boronide

**Sorium Harvesters**

For empires with access to gas giants, Sorium Harvesters provide an alternative fuel supply chain:

- **Ship Component:** Sorium Harvester modules are installed on ships during the design phase
- **Operation:** Ships with harvesters orbit a gas giant and automatically extract Sorium over time
- **Yield:** Harvester output depends on the module size and the gas giant's Sorium concentration
- **Delivery:** Harvested Sorium is stored in the ship's cargo hold and must be delivered to a colony for refining, or the ship can be designed with both harvesters and onboard refineries
- **Orbital Harvesting Facility:** An alternative is the orbital Sorium harvesting installation, which can be built in orbit of gas giants without requiring dedicated ships

**Fuel Production Planning**

To maintain adequate fuel supplies, consider:

1. **Current Consumption:** Calculate how much fuel your fleet burns per year at current operational tempo
2. **Growth Projection:** As your fleet expands, fuel needs will increase proportionally
3. **Reserve Target:** Maintain at least 6-12 months of fuel reserves on your primary colonies
4. **Distributed Production:** Build refineries at multiple colonies to avoid single points of failure
5. **Gas Giant Access:** Prioritize colonizing or establishing harvesters in systems with accessible gas giants

**Practical Tips:**

- Fuel shortages are one of the most common crises in mid-game Aurora; plan your refinery capacity well ahead of need
- Gas giant harvesting provides a very large but finite Sorium supply. As of v1.10.0, an event notification triggers when a gas giant or superjovian exhausts its Sorium reserves, alerting you to find alternative fuel sources
- Consider building dedicated harvester ships early; the upfront cost pays dividends in fuel security
- Monitor your fuel balance regularly; a negative trend means your consumption exceeds production and reserves will eventually run dry
- Refineries are cheap to build; when in doubt, build more than you think you need

## 14.1.2 Fuel Consumption

Ships consume fuel whenever they move. Understanding fuel consumption mechanics is essential for planning operations, designing ships with adequate range, and managing your logistics pipeline.

**Base Fuel Consumption**

Fuel consumption in Aurora C# is determined by the engine design and ship speed:

- **Engine Fuel Consumption:** Each engine type has a base fuel consumption rate measured in litres per hour per engine power unit
- **Speed Relationship:** Fuel consumption increases with the square of speed. A ship traveling at twice its cruise speed burns four times as much fuel
- **Ship Mass:** Heavier ships require more engine power to achieve the same speed, indirectly increasing total fuel consumption
- **Maximum Speed:** Ships always travel at their maximum speed unless specifically ordered to match a slower vessel in the task group

**Fuel Efficiency Technology**

Research in engine technology (see [Section 7.4 Tech Categories](../7-research/7.4-tech-categories.md)) affects fuel efficiency:

- **Fuel Consumption Modifier:** Engine designs include a fuel consumption modifier that can be set during the design phase. Lower consumption means less fuel used but also less engine power
- **Technology Progression:** Higher engine technology levels provide better power-to-fuel ratios
- **Engine Power Impact:** Fuel efficiency is heavily linked to engine power -- lower-power engines are vastly more fuel-efficient than high-power engines running at maximum output
- **Engine Size Impact:** Fuel efficiency is also somewhat linked to engine size -- larger engines are modestly more efficient than smaller engines at equivalent power settings
- **Design Trade-offs:** A ship designer must balance speed, fuel efficiency, and engine size. Maximum speed engines burn fuel rapidly; high-efficiency engines are slower but can operate for longer. Commercial vessels should prioritize fuel efficiency to prevent empire-wide shortages, while combat ships may sacrifice efficiency for higher power output

**Task Group Fuel Consumption**

When ships operate in task groups, fuel consumption follows specific rules:

- **Slowest Ship Speed:** A task group travels at the speed of its slowest member
- **Individual Consumption:** Each ship burns fuel based on its own engine characteristics at the group's travel speed
- **Matching Speed:** Ships with higher maximum speed consume less fuel when traveling at a slower ship's pace, since they are operating below their maximum

**Range Calculation**

A ship's range is displayed in the ship design window and represents the maximum distance it can travel on a full fuel load:

- **Range = Fuel Capacity / Consumption Rate x Speed**
- Range is calculated at maximum speed; traveling slower extends effective range
- The ship design window shows range in billions of kilometers
- Compare range to the distances between systems in your empire to ensure ships can reach their destinations

**Running Out of Fuel**

Ships that exhaust their fuel supply are stranded:

- The ship stops moving and cannot execute further movement orders
- The ship remains functional for sensors, weapons, and other systems (which do not consume fuel)
- Rescue requires sending a tanker to the stranded ship's location to transfer fuel
- Stranded ships are extremely vulnerable; they cannot evade threats

**Practical Tips:**

- Always check range before sending ships on long deployments; arriving at the destination on fumes with no local refueling is a common beginner mistake
- Design ships with fuel reserves appropriate to their mission; combat ships need enough fuel for patrol duty, not just a one-way trip
- Fuel consumption at maximum speed is dramatic; if you are sending ships on routine transits through safe space, consider lower-speed designs that save fuel
- Keep an eye on task group fuel levels during operations; the task group display shows current fuel as a percentage
- Station tankers at key waypoints along your supply lines to extend operational range of combat fleets
- The square-of-speed fuel consumption rule means that the fastest possible engine is rarely the most practical choice for most ships

## 14.1.3 Fuel Storage Components

Ship-mounted fuel storage in C# Aurora uses a tiered system offering improved economy of scale for larger modules. Fuel storage was substantially reduced in cost compared to VB6 Aurora, where it was disproportionately expensive relative to other storage modules (hangars, magazines, and cryo bays).

**Fuel Storage Module Costs:**

| Module Size | Capacity | Cost (BP) |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Tiny | 5,000 litres | 0.5 |
| Small | 10,000 litres | 0.8 |
| Standard | 50,000 litres | 2 |
| Large | 250,000 litres | 5 |
| Very Large | 1,000,000 litres | 10 |
| Ultra Large | 5,000,000 litres | 25 |

Larger fuel modules are proportionally more economical, making tanker designs more practical for extended operations. The cost reduction also significantly reduces build times for fuel-heavy ships such as tankers, since build time correlates with component costs adjusted for vessel size.

## 14.1.4 Fuel Management

Effective fuel management requires infrastructure for storage, transport, and distribution across your empire. This includes colonial fuel reserves, orbital fuel depots, tanker fleets, and careful planning of refueling points.

**Colony Fuel Reserves**

Each colony maintains a fuel stockpile that serves as both production output and consumption source:

- **Storage:** Colonies can store unlimited fuel in their reserves
- **Production Input:** Refineries deposit produced fuel directly into colony reserves
- **Consumption Source:** Ships in orbit can refuel directly from colony reserves
- **Transfer:** Fuel can be loaded onto tankers for transport to other locations
- **Monitoring:** The colony summary shows current fuel reserves and production/consumption rates

**Automated Refuel Toggle:** Each colony can be toggled to be ignored for automated refuelling orders. When ships execute standing or conditional orders involving refueling, the system normally selects the closest colony with fuel and suitable installations. By designating specific colonies as off-limits for automated refueling, players can reserve fuel supplies at strategic locations, direct fuel traffic toward distribution hubs, or prevent ships from detouring to nearby colonies when other refueling points are preferred.

**Fuel Depots**

For locations where you need fuel availability but do not have a full colony, fuel can be stored in space:

- **Orbital Fuel Depots:** Dedicated fuel storage facilities that can be placed in orbit of any body or at a waypoint
- **Capacity:** Each depot holds a fixed amount of fuel determined by its design
- **Refueling:** Ships can refuel from depots just as they would from a colony
- **Construction:** Depots are built at shipyards and towed or transported to their operating location

**Tanker Operations**

Tankers are ships designed with fuel storage capacity beyond their own needs, allowing them to refuel other ships:

- **Fuel Tankage Component:** The ship component that provides excess fuel capacity for distribution to other vessels
- **Refueling Orders:** Tankers can be ordered to refuel specific ships or entire task groups
- **Underway Replenishment:** Tankers can refuel combat ships without requiring them to return to a colony (see Section 14.3)
- **Shuttle Runs:** A common logistics pattern is having tankers make regular runs between refineries and forward operating areas

**Minimum Fuel Level:** Ship classes can be configured with a minimum fuel threshold. Ships will not unload or transfer fuel below this level, ensuring they retain operational reserves for contingencies. This replaces the VB6 system where tankers would only unload 90% of their fuel, giving players explicit control over logistics reserves. The minimum fuel setting applies to all fuel transfer and unloading operations.

**Fuel Distribution Strategy**

A well-designed fuel logistics network includes:

1. **Production Centers:** Colonies with abundant Sorium and many refineries, serving as primary fuel sources
2. **Forward Depots:** Fuel depots positioned along major transit routes and near operational areas
3. **Tanker Fleet:** Sufficient tanker capacity to keep forward depots supplied and refuel operational fleets
4. **Emergency Reserves:** Designated fuel reserves that are not drawn upon for routine operations

**Fuel as a Strategic Resource**

Fuel availability constrains your strategic options:

- **Offensive Operations:** Long-range offensive missions require extensive tanker support or pre-positioned fuel depots
- **Defensive Operations:** Ships defending their home system can refuel easily from colony reserves, giving defenders a significant logistical advantage
- **Chokepoint Control:** Controlling systems with gas giants gives you fuel access while denying it to enemies
- **Economic Warfare:** Destroying enemy fuel infrastructure (refineries, harvesters, tankers) can cripple their fleet operations

**Practical Tips:**

- Build tankers early; they are unsexy but absolutely essential for sustained operations beyond your home system
- Pre-position fuel depots at jump points along your major transit routes; this extends effective fleet range enormously
- Design your tankers with enough speed to keep up with your fleet train but prioritize fuel capacity over combat capability
- Monitor fuel production vs. consumption empire-wide; a growing fleet means growing fuel needs
- Gas giant systems are strategically valuable out of proportion to their other resources due to the renewable fuel supply they provide
- Consider fuel implications when planning colony locations; a colony with no local Sorium and no nearby gas giant will be dependent on fuel imports forever
- In wartime, protect your tankers; losing your tanker fleet can strand your combat ships far from home
