# 3.2 System Map

## 3.2.1 Navigation and Zoom

The system map is the primary visual representation of a star system. It displays stars, planets, moons, ships, fleets, jump points, and other objects in their orbital positions. Understanding map navigation is essential for effective gameplay.

**Zoom Controls:**
- **Mouse Wheel**: Scroll up to zoom in, scroll down to zoom out. The zoom centers on the cursor position.
- **Zoom Buttons**: Toolbar buttons for incremental zoom in/out
- **Preset Zoom Levels**: Quick buttons to jump to specific scale levels (inner system, full system, etc.)
- The map can zoom from showing the entire system (potentially billions of kilometers across) down to individual orbit details

**Panning:**
- **Click and Drag**: Hold the mouse button and drag to pan the view across the system
- **Center on Object**: Double-clicking an object (or using center commands) reframes the view on that object
- **Center on Star**: A quick-center button returns the view to the system primary star

**Centering Options:**
- Center on the primary star (home position)
- Center on a selected fleet or ship
- Center on a planet or moon
- Center on a jump point
- The currently centered object may be highlighted or indicated in the display

**Scale Indicator**: The map displays a scale reference so you can judge distances. Distances in Aurora are measured in millions of kilometers (Mkm) or astronomical units (AU) depending on scale.

**System Selection**: A dropdown or selector allows you to switch which star system the map displays. Only systems you have explored (sent ships to) are available for viewing, unless SpaceMaster mode is active.

**Multi-Star Systems**: In binary or trinary systems, the map shows all stars and their associated orbital bodies. You can zoom and pan between the components of the system.

## 3.2.2 Display Layers

The system map can show or hide various categories of information. Managing display layers prevents visual clutter while ensuring you see what you need.

**Orbital Bodies:**
- **Stars**: Always displayed as the central reference point(s)
- **Planets**: Major planetary bodies shown at their orbital positions
- **Moons**: Can be toggled; showing moons adds detail but increases clutter around gas giants with many satellites
- **Asteroids**: Individual asteroids or asteroid belt indicators
- **Comets**: Distant icy bodies, usually hidden by default
- **Dwarf Planets**: Smaller bodies that may not be shown at all zoom levels

**Orbital Paths:**
- **Planet Orbits**: Circular or elliptical lines showing planetary orbits. Helpful for understanding system geometry.
- **Moon Orbits**: Orbital paths of moons around their parent planets
- **Ship Movement Lines**: Lines showing the planned path of moving ships/fleets

**Ships and Fleets:**
- **Player Fleets**: Your own ships and fleet formations, typically shown as distinct icons
- **Contacts**: Detected objects belonging to other races (shown based on sensor data)
- **Civilian Ships**: Player-owned civilian shipping (freighters, colony ships operating autonomously)
- **Fleet Names/Labels**: Text labels identifying fleets, which can clutter the display in busy systems

**Strategic Elements:**
- **Jump Points**: The connection points between star systems, shown as icons at their locations in the system
- **Survey Markers**: Indicators showing which bodies have been geologically surveyed
- **Waypoints**: Custom markers you have placed for navigation reference
- **Mineral Icons**: Indicators showing mineral availability on surveyed bodies

**Sensor Information:**
- **Sensor Ranges**: Circles showing the detection range of active sensors (thermal, electromagnetic)
- **Missile Markers**: Missile salvos in flight (during combat)
- **Gravitational Survey Progress**: Areas that have been surveyed for jump points vs. unsurveyed regions

**Display Tips:**
- Reduce clutter by hiding moon orbits and asteroid details when viewing the full system
- Enable fleet names only when you need to identify specific groups
- Sensor range circles are invaluable during combat setup but distracting during peacetime
- Save your preferred display configuration once you find settings you like

## 3.2.3 Selecting Objects

Interacting with objects on the system map is how you inspect planets, give fleet orders, and gather information about your empire and contacts.

**Clicking Objects:**
- **Left-Click**: Selects an object, displaying its information in the associated panel or status area
- **Left-Click on Fleets**: Selects the fleet, showing its composition, current orders, and speed
- **Left-Click on Planets**: Selects the body, showing summary information (name, type, colony status if applicable)
- **Left-Click on Jump Points**: Shows the jump point details and destination (if explored)

**Right-Click Context:**
- Right-clicking objects or locations may provide context-specific options
- Common right-click actions include setting fleet destinations, querying object details, or accessing related windows

**Selection Panel:**
When an object is selected, detailed information appears (typically in a side panel or popup):
- **For Planets**: Name, type, gravity, temperature, atmosphere summary, colony cost, mineral survey status, population (if colonized)
- **For Fleets**: Fleet name, number of ships, current orders, speed, fuel status, assigned commander
- **For Jump Points**: Destination system name (if explored), transit status, any assigned patrol fleets
- **For Contacts**: Detected type (thermal/electromagnetic signature), estimated size, bearing, speed

**Fleet Orders from the Map:**
You can issue basic movement orders directly from the system map:
1. Select a fleet
2. Right-click (or use the appropriate control) on a destination (planet, jump point, coordinates)
3. The fleet will plot a course and begin moving on the next time advance

For complex orders (conditional movement, patrol routes, survey assignments), use the Fleet Window instead. The map provides quick point-to-point movement commands.

**Multiple Object Overlap:**
In crowded areas (near planets with moons, or systems with many fleets in one location), multiple objects may overlap visually. Clicking in these areas may:
- Select the topmost/nearest object
- Provide a selection list letting you choose which overlapping object you intend
- Zoom in to separate overlapping elements

**Keyboard Interaction:**
- Arrow keys may pan the map
- Certain hotkeys select the next/previous fleet
- Keyboard shortcuts can toggle display layers without using the toolbar

**Practical Map Usage:**
- Keep the map centered on areas of current activity (your home system, a system under survey, a combat zone)
- Use the map to visually verify fleet positions match your expectations before advancing time
- Regularly check the map for unidentified contacts — these could be NPR ships entering your space
- The map's visual representation helps catch errors (ships heading the wrong direction, fleets stuck in orbit) that text-only displays might miss
