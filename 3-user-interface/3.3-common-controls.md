# 3.3 Common Controls

## 3.3.1 Data Grids

Aurora makes extensive use of data grids (tables) throughout its interface. Understanding how these grids work is essential, as they appear in nearly every window — ship lists, mineral inventories, research projects, fleet compositions, and more.

**Column Behavior:**
- **Column Headers**: Click a column header to sort the grid by that column. Click again to reverse sort order (ascending/descending).
- **Column Width**: Columns can typically be resized by dragging the header borders. Some columns have fixed widths.
- **Column Content**: Cells display text, numbers, or occasionally icons. Numeric columns right-align for readability.

**Sorting:**
- Single-click on any column header sorts by that column
- The currently sorted column may be indicated with an arrow or highlight
- Sorting is essential for finding specific items in large lists (e.g., finding the fastest ship, the richest mineral deposit, the highest-priority research project)
- Not all grids support sorting on every column

**Row Selection:**
- Click a row to select it. The selected row is typically highlighted.
- In some windows, selecting a row populates detail fields below the grid (e.g., selecting a ship class shows its components)
- Double-clicking a row may open a detail view or perform a default action
- Some grids support multi-row selection (Ctrl+Click or Shift+Click), but this is not universal

**Filtering:**
- Some grids include filter controls (dropdowns or text boxes above the grid) that limit displayed rows
- Common filters include: system selection (show only items in this system), type selection (show only this category), status filters (show only active/inactive items)
- Filters are typically applied immediately and can be combined
- Clearing all filters shows the complete list

**Data Grid Tips:**
- When a grid shows an unexpectedly small list, check for active filters that may be hiding entries
- Sort by different columns to answer different questions about the same data set
- Many grids update in real-time as game state changes (after time advancement)
- If a grid seems empty when it should not be, verify you have the correct race/system selected

## 3.3.2 Dropdown Conventions

Dropdown menus (combo boxes) are Aurora's primary method for context selection. They appear at the top of most windows and control which subset of data is displayed.

**Common Dropdown Patterns:**

**System Selector:**
- Present in most windows that deal with location-specific data
- Shows a list of all explored star systems
- Changing this dropdown updates the entire window to show only items in the selected system
- Some windows default to "All Systems" while others default to the system currently displayed on the map

**Race/Empire Selector:**
- In SpaceMaster mode, a race selector appears allowing you to view data for any race
- In normal play, this defaults to your own race and may be hidden
- Useful for managing multiple player races in the same game

**Colony Selector:**
- In the Economics window and related displays, a dropdown lists all colonies
- Selecting a colony shows its population, installations, production queues, and mineral stockpiles
- Colonies are typically listed by name and may include system information

**Fleet/Ship Selector:**
- The Fleet window uses dropdowns to select which fleet you are viewing and commanding
- Ship selectors within a fleet show individual vessel details
- These often cascade — selecting a fleet populates a ship list within that fleet

**Category Filters:**
- Many windows include category dropdowns (e.g., research field, component type, mineral type)
- These narrow the displayed information to a specific category
- Combined with grid sorting, they allow quick navigation of large data sets

**Dropdown Tips:**
- If a window appears empty, the most common cause is having the wrong system, colony, or fleet selected in a dropdown
- Dropdowns sometimes interact — changing one may reset or update another
- When switching between windows, verify dropdown selections match your intent
- Some dropdowns support type-ahead: start typing to jump to matching entries in long lists

## 3.3.3 Keyboard Shortcuts

Aurora C# supports keyboard shortcuts for common actions, though the interface is primarily mouse-driven. Known shortcuts help speed up repetitive tasks.

**Time Advancement:**
- The time increment buttons may have associated keyboard shortcuts for quick advancement
- Repeatedly pressing the advance shortcut processes successive time increments without needing to click
- This is particularly useful during long peacetime development phases

**Window Management:**
- Some windows can be opened with keyboard shortcuts from the main window
- Alt+Key combinations may activate menu items following Windows conventions
- F-keys may be mapped to common windows (varies by version)

**Map Controls:**
- Arrow keys: Pan the system map
- +/- keys: Zoom in/out on the map
- Home or equivalent: Center the map on the primary star

**Grid Navigation:**
- Up/Down arrows: Move selection between rows in data grids
- Enter: Confirm selection or perform default action on selected row
- Tab: Move between fields in data entry areas

**General:**
- Escape: Close the current window or cancel an operation
- Ctrl+Z: Undo in some text fields (not universal)
- Standard Windows shortcuts (Ctrl+C for copy) work in text fields

**Important Notes:**
- Aurora's keyboard shortcut system is not as comprehensive as many modern games
- Not all actions have keyboard equivalents — many operations require mouse interaction
- Shortcut keys are not typically rebindable
- When in doubt, use the mouse — Aurora was designed as a mouse-driven interface
- Check the forums for community-compiled shortcut lists, as documentation in-game may be limited

**Mouse Shortcuts:**
- Double-click on many list items opens a detail view
- Right-click provides context menus in some areas (particularly the system map)
- Mouse wheel scrolls in grids and zooms on the map
- Middle-click behavior varies by window
