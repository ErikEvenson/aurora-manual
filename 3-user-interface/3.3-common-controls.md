# 3.3 Common Controls

## 3.3.1 Data Grids

*Updated: v2026.01.30*

Aurora makes extensive use of data grids (tables) throughout its interface. Understanding how these grids work is essential, as they appear in nearly every window -- ship lists, mineral inventories, research projects, fleet compositions, and more. Aurora uses standard .NET Windows Forms DataGridView controls for most data grids. \hyperlink{ref-3.3-4}{[4]}

**Column Behavior:**

- **Column Headers**: Click a column header to sort the grid by that column. Click again to reverse sort order (ascending/descending).
- **Column Width**: Columns can typically be resized by dragging the header borders. Some columns have fixed widths.
- **Column Content**: Cells display text, numbers, or occasionally icons. Numeric columns right-align for readability.

**Sorting:**

- Single-click on any column header sorts by that column
- The currently sorted column may be indicated with an arrow or highlight
- Sorting is essential for finding specific items in large lists (e.g., finding the fastest ship, the richest mineral deposit, the highest-priority research project)
- Not all grids support sorting on every column

**Row Selection:**

- Click a row to select it. The selected row is typically highlighted.
- In some windows, selecting a row populates detail fields below the grid (e.g., selecting a ship class shows its components)
- Double-clicking a row may open a detail view or perform a default action
- Some grids support multi-row selection (Ctrl+Click or Shift+Click), but this is not universal

**Filtering:**

- Some grids include filter controls (dropdowns or text boxes above the grid) that limit displayed rows
- Common filters include: system selection (show only items in this system), type selection (show only this category), status filters (show only active/inactive items)
- Filters are typically applied immediately and can be combined
- Clearing all filters shows the complete list

**Data Grid Tips:**

- When a grid shows an unexpectedly small list, check for active filters that may be hiding entries
- Sort by different columns to answer different questions about the same data set
- Many grids update in real-time as game state changes (after time advancement)
- If a grid seems empty when it should not be, verify you have the correct race/system selected

## 3.3.2 Dropdown Conventions

*Updated: v2026.01.30*

Dropdown menus (combo boxes) are Aurora's primary method for context selection. They appear at the top of most windows and control which subset of data is displayed.

**Common Dropdown Patterns:**

**System Selector:**

- Present in most windows that deal with location-specific data
- Shows a list of all explored star systems
- Changing this dropdown updates the entire window to show only items in the selected system
- Some windows default to "All Systems" while others default to the system currently displayed on the map

**Race/Empire Selector:**

- In SpaceMaster mode, a race selector appears allowing you to view data for any race
- In normal play, this defaults to your own race and may be hidden
- Useful for managing multiple player races in the same game

**Colony Selector:**

- In the Economics window and related displays, a dropdown lists all colonies
- Selecting a colony shows its population, installations, production queues, and mineral stockpiles
- Colonies are typically listed by name and may include system information

**Fleet/Ship Selector:**

- The Fleet window uses dropdowns to select which fleet you are viewing and commanding
- Ship selectors within a fleet show individual vessel details
- These often cascade -- selecting a fleet populates a ship list within that fleet

**Category Filters:**

- Many windows include category dropdowns (e.g., research field, component type, mineral type)
- These narrow the displayed information to a specific category
- Combined with grid sorting, they allow quick navigation of large data sets

**Dropdown Tips:**

- If a window appears empty, the most common cause is having the wrong system, colony, or fleet selected in a dropdown
- Dropdowns sometimes interact -- changing one may reset or update another
- When switching between windows, verify dropdown selections match your intent
- Some dropdowns support type-ahead: start typing to jump to matching entries in long lists

## 3.3.3 Keyboard Shortcuts

*Updated: v2026.01.30*

Aurora C# supports comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for opening game windows, introduced in v1.10.0 \hyperlink{ref-3.3-1}{[1]}. These hotkeys provide quick access to 18 different game windows (F2-F11 open 10 windows, Ctrl+F2-Ctrl+F11 open 8 additional windows; F12 and Ctrl+F12 are toggles rather than windows) \hyperlink{ref-3.3-1}{[1]}.

### 3.3.3.1 Function Key Shortcuts (F2-F12)

The following shortcuts open game windows directly: \hyperlink{ref-3.3-1}{[1]}

| Key | Window |
|-----|--------|
| F2 | Population Summary |
| F3 | Commanders Window |
| F4 | Naval Organization |
| F5 | Class Design |
| F6 | Diplomacy and Intelligence |
| F7 | Race Window |
| F8 | Ground Forces |
| F9 | System View |
| F10 | Create Project |
| F11 | Galactic Map |
| F12 | Toggle Automated Turns |

### 3.3.3.2 Control+Function Key Shortcuts (Ctrl+F2-F12)

The Control modifier accesses additional windows: \hyperlink{ref-3.3-1}{[1]}

| Key | Window |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl+F2 | Events |
| Ctrl+F3 | Medals |
| Ctrl+F4 | Industry |
| Ctrl+F5 | Research |
| Ctrl+F6 | Mining |
| Ctrl+F7 | Wealth |
| Ctrl+F8 | View Technology |
| Ctrl+F9 | Sectors |
| Ctrl+F10 | Missile Design |
| Ctrl+F11 | Turret Design |
| Ctrl+F12 | SM Mode |

### 3.3.3.3 Shift Modifier for Multiple Windows

Holding Shift while using any of the above shortcuts will create a second instance of that window, functioning the same as when clicking a toolbar button with Shift held. For example, Ctrl+Shift+F4 opens a second Economics window at the Industry tab. This is useful for comparing data side-by-side.

### 3.3.3.4 Map Controls

- Arrow keys: Pan the system map
- +/- keys: Zoom in/out on the map
- Home: Center the map on the primary star *(unverified — [#714](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/714) -- the specific key binding has not been confirmed in available sources)*
- Alt+F11: Cycle backward through previous map center locations (history tracked since game load, added v1.12.0)
- Alt+F12: Cycle forward through previous map center locations (history tracked since game load, added v1.12.0)
- Shift+Drag: Measure distance between two points on the tactical map *(unverified — [#714](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/714) -- exact display unit not confirmed; see [Section 3.2.6 Distance Measuring](3.2-system-map.md) for details)*

### 3.3.3.5 Grid Navigation

*(The following shortcuts are standard Windows data grid conventions and are expected to work in Aurora, but have not been verified against an Aurora-specific source.)*

- Up/Down arrows: Move selection between rows in data grids *(unverified — [#714](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/714))*
- Enter: Confirm selection or perform default action on selected row *(unverified — [#714](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/714))*
- Tab: Move between fields in data entry areas *(unverified — [#714](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/714))*

### 3.3.3.6 General

*(The following shortcuts are standard Windows conventions and are expected to work in Aurora, but have not been verified against an Aurora-specific source.)*

- Escape: Close the current window or cancel an operation *(unverified — [#714](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/714))*
- Ctrl+Z: Undo in some text fields (not universal) *(unverified — [#714](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/714))*
- Standard Windows shortcuts (Ctrl+C for copy) work in text fields *(unverified — [#714](https://github.com/ErikEvenson/aurora-manual/issues/714))*

**Important Notes:**

- Shortcut keys are not rebindable
- Not all actions have keyboard equivalents -- many operations require mouse interaction
- The F-key shortcuts work from the main window and most sub-windows

**Mouse Shortcuts:**

- Double-click on many list items opens a detail view
- Right-click provides context menus in some areas (particularly the system map)
- Mouse wheel scrolls in grids and zooms on the map
- Middle-click behavior varies by window

**System View Double-Click:**

*Added: v2.7.0*

Double-clicking system bodies in the System View window centers the Tactical Map on that location \hyperlink{ref-3.3-5}{[5]}. This provides a navigation shortcut for quickly moving the map view to specific bodies without manually zooming and panning.
