# 3.1 Main Window

## 3.1.1 Menu Bar

The menu bar along the top of the Aurora window provides access to all game windows and functions. It is organized into logical categories.

**Key Menu Categories:**

**Economics / Industry:**
- **Economics Window**: The central hub for colony management — shows populations, installations, production queues, mineral stockpiles, and industry assignments for each colony
- **Mining**: Detailed view of mining operations across your empire
- **Wealth/Trade**: Financial systems including trade routes and civilian economy

**Ship Operations:**
- **Ship Design**: Create and modify ship classes (the blueprint, not individual ships)
- **Fleet Window / Naval Organization**: Manage fleets, assign ships, give movement orders
- **Class Design**: Detailed component-level ship design interface

**Research:**
- **Research Window**: Assign scientists to projects, manage research priorities, view the technology tree

**Military:**
- **Ground Forces**: Design, train, and manage army units
- **Intelligence**: Espionage and counter-intelligence operations

**Exploration:**
- **System View / Galactic Map**: Navigate between star systems and view the known galaxy
- **Survey Locations**: Track survey progress across your explored territory

**Administration:**
- **Commander Window**: View and assign all commanders (officers, scientists, governors, admirals)
- **Race / Empire Settings**: Manage high-level empire configuration
- **Diplomacy**: Interact with known races

**Game Management:**
- **Game Setup**: Access game creation and configuration
- **SpaceMaster**: Toggle omniscient mode for game management
- **Medals / Awards**: View service records and decorations

Most players quickly develop the habit of keeping certain windows open at all times (Economics, Fleet, and the System Map being the most common persistent windows) while opening others as needed.

## 3.1.2 Toolbar

Below the menu bar, the toolbar provides quick-access buttons for the most commonly used windows and functions. These duplicate menu functions but save navigation time.

**Common Toolbar Buttons:**

- **Economics**: One-click access to colony management
- **Fleet/Naval**: Open fleet management and movement orders
- **Research**: Jump directly to the research interface
- **Ship Design**: Open the ship design system
- **System Map Controls**: Zoom, center, and display toggles for the map
- **SpaceMaster Toggle**: Quick toggle for GM mode
- **Time Controls**: Adjacent to or integrated with the time increment system

**Toolbar Tips:**
- Hovering over toolbar buttons typically shows a tooltip identifying the function
- The toolbar layout is fixed — it cannot be customized or rearranged
- Learning the toolbar layout saves significant time compared to menu navigation for frequently accessed windows
- Some toolbar buttons may appear grayed out if their function is not currently available (e.g., certain SpaceMaster-only functions when SpaceMaster is disabled)

## 3.1.3 Status Bar

The status bar (typically at the bottom or top of the main window) displays critical game state information and provides the time advancement controls.

**Game Time Display:**
The current in-game date and time are always visible. Aurora uses a date format showing year, month, day, and time of day. This is your primary reference for when events occur and how much time has passed.

**Time Increment Controls:**

The time increment system is how you advance the game clock. Aurora is not real-time — nothing happens until you explicitly advance time. The available increments are:

| Increment | Typical Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| 5 seconds | Detailed combat resolution, precise timing |
| 30 seconds | Combat, close-range tactical maneuvering |
| 2 minutes | Short-range combat, orbital operations |
| 5 minutes | Extended combat, in-system transits |
| 20 minutes | In-system travel, patrol operations |
| 1 hour | Routine in-system operations |
| 3 hours | Standard movement periods |
| 8 hours | Shift-based operations |
| 1 day | Peacetime development, short construction |
| 5 days | Standard peacetime increment |
| 30 days | Extended peacetime, long construction projects |

**How Time Advancement Works:**
1. Select your desired increment using the controls
2. Click the advance button (or use the keyboard shortcut)
3. Aurora processes all events, movement, construction, research, and other activities for that time period
4. If an interrupt event occurs (hostile contact, research completion, etc.), the advance stops at that point regardless of the selected increment
5. Event messages appear in the Event Log for anything notable that occurred

**Practical Time Management:**
- During peacetime development: Use 5-day or 30-day increments to progress quickly
- When ships are in transit: Match your increment to expected arrival times
- During combat: Drop to 5-30 second increments for fine control
- After any hostile contact: Immediately reduce increment length until the situation is resolved
- The game auto-interrupts on significant events, but you should still match increment to situation — a 30-day increment during an active battle means 30 days of uncontrolled combat

**Sub-Pulse Processing**: Within each time increment, Aurora processes events in sub-pulses (typically 5-second intervals for combat). This means even a 30-day advance will correctly resolve combat encounters that occur during transit — ships do not "teleport past" enemies.

**Current Race Indicator**: The status bar also shows which race you are currently controlling. In a game with multiple player races or when using SpaceMaster mode, this confirms whose perspective you are viewing.
