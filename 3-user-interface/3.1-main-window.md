# 3.1 Main Window

## 3.1.1 Menu Bar

The menu bar along the top of the Aurora window provides access to all game windows and functions. It is organized into logical categories.

**Key Menu Categories:**

**Economics / Industry:**

- **Economics Window**: The central hub for colony management — shows populations, installations, production queues, mineral stockpiles, and industry assignments for each colony
- **Mining**: Detailed view of mining operations across your empire
- **Wealth/Trade**: Financial systems including trade routes and civilian economy

**Ship Operations:**

- **Ship Design**: Create and modify ship classes (see [Section 8.1 Design Philosophy](../8-ship-design/8.1-design-philosophy.md)) (the blueprint, not individual ships)
- **Fleet Window / Naval Organization**: Manage fleets, assign ships, give movement orders (see [Section 9.1 Shipyards](../9-fleet-management/9.1-shipyards.md))
- **Class Design**: Detailed component-level ship design interface

**Research:**

- **Research Window**: Assign scientists to projects, manage research priorities, view the technology tree (see [Section 7.1 Technology Tree](../7-research/7.1-technology-tree.md))

**Military:**

- **Ground Forces**: Design, train, and manage army units (see [Section 13.1 Unit Types and Formation Design](../13-ground-forces/13.1-unit-types.md))
- **Intelligence**: Espionage and counter-intelligence operations

**Exploration:**

- **System View / Galactic Map**: Navigate between star systems and view the known galaxy
- **Survey Locations**: Track survey progress across your explored territory

**Administration:**

- **Commander Window**: View and assign all commanders (officers, scientists, governors, admirals)
- **Race / Empire Settings**: Manage high-level empire configuration
- **Diplomacy**: Interact with known races (see [Section 15.1 Alien Races](../15-diplomacy/15.1-alien-races.md))

**Game Management:**

- **Game Setup**: Access game creation and configuration
- **SpaceMaster**: Toggle omniscient mode for game management
- **Medals / Awards**: View service records and decorations

Most players quickly develop the habit of keeping certain windows open at all times (Economics, Fleet, and the System Map being the most common persistent windows) while opening others as needed.

## 3.1.2 Save System

C# Aurora uses a manual save system rather than continually updating to disk (as VB6 Aurora did), which is one of the reasons the C# version runs much faster.

**Save Button:**

A dedicated Save Button on the toolbar triggers the save process. When activated:

1. The database prior to the save is copied to a new file called `AuroraDBSaveBackup.db`
2. The `AuroraDB.db` file is then updated with the current game state
3. The previous `AuroraDBSaveBackup.db` is automatically copied to `AuroraDBPreviousSaveBackup.db`

This provides automatic backups of your last two saves at all times.

**Save Performance:**

As of v1.10.0, the entire database save runs within a single transaction, resulting in save times of under five seconds on mid-campaign databases -- at least 5x faster than earlier versions. This improvement becomes increasingly beneficial as campaign databases grow in size.

**Data Loss Prevention:**

- If you close Aurora without saving, your game reverts to the last save
- To restore a previous save, delete `AuroraDB.db` and rename the desired backup file to `AuroraDB.db`

**Event Colour Import/Export:**

The Events Window provides Import and Export buttons for event colour configurations, allowing customization to be shared across races and games:

- **Export Colours:** Prompts for a file name and location, then saves a CSV file containing Event ID, Background Colour (integer), and Text Colour (integer) -- one row per event type. These values correspond to the `DIM_EventType` and `FCT_EventColour` database tables.
- **Import Colours:** Reads a CSV file in the same format. Only event types referenced in the file are updated; unmentioned event types retain their existing colour settings. This enables partial updates without disrupting your full colour scheme.

This portability feature is particularly useful when starting new games or creating multiple races, as you can maintain a consistent event display without reconfiguring colours manually each time.

## 3.1.3 Toolbar

Below the menu bar, the toolbar provides quick-access buttons for the most commonly used windows and functions. These duplicate menu functions but save navigation time.

**Common Toolbar Buttons:**

- **Economics**: One-click access to colony management
- **Fleet/Naval**: Open fleet management and movement orders
- **Research**: Jump directly to the research interface
- **Ship Design**: Open the ship design system
- **System Map Controls**: Zoom, center, and display toggles for the map
- **SpaceMaster Toggle**: Quick toggle for GM mode
- **Time Controls**: Adjacent to or integrated with the time increment system

**Toolbar Tips:**

- Hovering over toolbar buttons typically shows a tooltip identifying the function
- The toolbar layout is fixed — it cannot be customized or rearranged
- Learning the toolbar layout saves significant time compared to menu navigation for frequently accessed windows
- Some toolbar buttons may appear grayed out if their function is not currently available (e.g., certain SpaceMaster-only functions when SpaceMaster is disabled)

## 3.1.4 Logistics Reports

The Fleet Window includes a Logistics Reports tab that provides a comprehensive overview of fleet supply status across five categories. These reports allow commanders to quickly identify vessels requiring immediate attention.

**Report Categories:**

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Fuel | Fuel reserves across the fleet |
| Maintenance Supply Points (MSP) | MSP levels for each ship |
| Ordnance | Ammunition and weapons loadout status |
| Deployment Time | Duration of current crew deployment |
| Time Since Overhaul | Interval since last maintenance overhaul |

**Functionality:**

- Ships are sorted by those most affected in the selected category, putting the most urgent needs first
- A dropdown menu switches between the five report categories
- This tool helps maintain situational awareness regarding fleet supply status and maintenance requirements during extended campaigns

## 3.1.5 Race Comparison Window

The Race Comparison Window is a read-only interface that displays side-by-side comparisons between different player races within a single game. It provides a high-level overview for quick reference during gameplay.

**Key Features:**

- The window automatically expands to accommodate the number of player races present in the game
- Dynamically scales to ensure all player races are visible without scrolling when possible
- Designed as a quick reference tool rather than an interactive editing interface
- Additional comparison information may be expanded over time

## 3.1.6 Mineral Search Window

The Mineral Search Window enables systematic location of celestial bodies meeting specific mineral requirements. It provides enhanced flexibility compared to earlier versions.

**Search Capabilities:**

- Specify minimum amounts and accessibilities for every mineral simultaneously
- Results are ordered by the mineral with the highest minimum amount specified
- Filters operate sequentially from left to right (e.g., selecting gas giants exclusively makes asteroid specifications irrelevant)
- Amounts are aligned in columns for straightforward comparison across multiple celestial bodies

**Example Usage:**

Search for all bodies with at least 1,000 tons of Duranium with 0.3 accessibility or higher, then further refine by adding a minimum of 1 ton of Sorium to narrow results.

**Mineral Search Flag:**

Players can mark individual systems with a "Mineral Search Flag" from the galactic map interface. A display option controls which systems show their flag status. The Mineral Search Window can then restrict searches to systems with the flag set, in conjunction with the existing filters. This enables targeted mineral searching within a subset of systems rather than searching only a single system or all systems simultaneously.

## 3.1.7 Screen Resolution

C# Aurora launches with a minimum resolution of **1440 x 900**. Most windows maintain fixed, non-resizable layouts to ensure consistent UI presentation across different monitor configurations.

**Resizable Windows:**

- **Tactical Map and Galactic Map**: These windows can be resized and expanded to fill the entire screen, allowing players to maximize their viewing area for strategic purposes.
- **Class Design Window**: Includes a dedicated "Wide" option that expands the interface to approximately 1800 x 900 pixels, providing additional horizontal space for reviewing complex ship design specifications.
- **System View Window**: Has a "Wide" variant at 1900 pixels (vs. 1440 for normal view), displaying an extra six columns of system body data. This is particularly useful for monitoring eccentric orbit information.

All other windows use fixed dimensions and cannot be resized.

## 3.1.8 Linked Windows

C# Aurora includes a feature to synchronize multiple open windows. When the linked windows option is activated, changing the current Race in one window automatically updates the race/faction displayed across all other open windows simultaneously. This eliminates the need to manually switch each window individually when reviewing or managing information for a different civilization.

This feature is particularly useful when managing multiple player races in the same game or when using SpaceMaster mode to oversee different factions.

## 3.1.9 Multiple Window Instances

In C# Aurora, players can open multiple instances of most windows simultaneously. The **tactical map is the sole exception** and remains limited to a single instance.

**Supported Windows for Multiple Instances:**

- Class windows
- Galactic map windows
- Fleet windows
- Ground Forces windows
- Economics windows
- And most other standard interface windows

**Practical Applications:**

- Transferring ships between fleets displayed in separate fleet windows via drag-and-drop
- Moving ground units between different Ground Forces window hierarchies
- Comparing ship classes side-by-side using multiple class windows
- Viewing different colonies simultaneously in separate Economics windows

**Opening Additional Instances:**

- Hold **Shift** while clicking a toolbar button to open a second instance of that window
- Hold **Shift** while using keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+F4 opens a second Economics window at the Industry tab)

## 3.1.10 Keep Tactical Map in Background

The Tactical Map serves as the main game window in C# Aurora. When opening other windows from the toolbar, the Tactical Map normally gains focus and moves to the front, placing previously-opened windows behind it.

The **"Keep Tactical in Background"** option addresses this. When enabled, after pressing a toolbar button on the Tactical Map to open a new window, the Tactical Map automatically moves to the background, leaving all other windows in front of it and the newly opened window on top.

This allows players to maintain visibility of multiple windows simultaneously without manual repositioning, making multi-window gameplay significantly more efficient.

## 3.1.11 Status Bar

The status bar (typically at the bottom or top of the main window) displays critical game state information and provides the time advancement controls.

**Game Time Display:**
The current in-game date and time are always visible. Aurora uses a date format showing year, month, day, and time of day. This is your primary reference for when events occur and how much time has passed.

**Time Increment Controls:**

The time increment system is how you advance the game clock. Aurora is not real-time — nothing happens until you explicitly advance time. The available increments are:

| Increment | Typical Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| 5 seconds | Detailed combat resolution, precise timing |
| 30 seconds | Combat, close-range tactical maneuvering |
| 2 minutes | Short-range combat, orbital operations |
| 5 minutes | Extended combat, in-system transits |
| 20 minutes | In-system travel, patrol operations |
| 1 hour | Routine in-system operations |
| 3 hours | Standard movement periods |
| 8 hours | Shift-based operations |
| 1 day | Peacetime development, short construction |
| 5 days | Standard peacetime increment |
| 30 days | Extended peacetime, long construction projects |

**How Time Advancement Works:**
1. Select your desired increment using the controls
2. Click the advance button (or use the keyboard shortcut)
3. Aurora processes all events, movement, construction, research, and other activities for that time period
4. If an interrupt event occurs (hostile contact, research completion, etc.), the advance stops at that point regardless of the selected increment
5. Event messages appear in the Event Log for anything notable that occurred

**Practical Time Management:**

- During peacetime development: Use 5-day or 30-day increments to progress quickly
- When ships are in transit: Match your increment to expected arrival times
- During combat: Drop to 5-30 second increments for fine control
- After any hostile contact: Immediately reduce increment length until the situation is resolved
- The game auto-interrupts on significant events, but you should still match increment to situation — a 30-day increment during an active battle means 30 days of uncontrolled combat

**Sub-Pulse Processing**: Within each time increment, Aurora processes events in sub-pulses (typically 5-second intervals for combat). This means even a 30-day advance will correctly resolve combat encounters that occur during transit — ships do not "teleport past" enemies.

**Current Race Indicator**: The status bar also shows which race you are currently controlling. In a game with multiple player races or when using SpaceMaster mode, this confirms whose perspective you are viewing.
