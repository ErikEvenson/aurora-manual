# 3.4 Event Log

*Added: v2026.01.23*


## 3.4.1 Event Types

The Event Log is Aurora's primary communication channel to the player. Since the game processes events in batches during time advances (rather than in real-time), the Event Log records everything significant that occurred during each increment. Learning to read and respond to events is a core gameplay skill.

**Major Event Categories:**

**Military / Combat Events:**

- **Hostile Contact**: An unknown or hostile ship has been detected (see [Section 11.1 Thermal and EM Signatures](../11-sensors-and-detection/11.1-thermal-em-signatures.md)). This is often the first warning of an NPR presence.
- **Weapons Fire**: Ships have engaged targets -- includes details on weapons used, hits, and damage
- **Ship Destroyed**: A ship (yours or enemy) has been destroyed
- **Missile Launch / Impact**: Missile salvos launched or striking targets
- **Shield/Armor Damage**: Damage reports for ships under fire
- **Crew Casualties**: Personnel losses on damaged ships

**Exploration Events:**

- **Jump point discovered**: A gravitational survey has revealed a new jump point
- **Jump point transit**: A ship has transited a jump point to a new system
- **New System Explored**: First entry into a previously unknown system
- **Geological Survey Complete**: A body has been fully surveyed for minerals
- **Minerals Found**: A geological survey has detected mineral deposits (includes quantities and accessibility)

**Research Events:**

- **Research Complete**: A technology has been successfully researched (see [Section 7.1 Technology Tree](../7-research/7.1-technology-tree.md))
- **Breakthrough**: A scientist has achieved a breakthrough, accelerating research
- **New Technology Available**: Completing one technology unlocks new research options

**Economic Events:**

- **Construction Complete**: A ship, installation, or other project has finished building
- **Shipyard Task Complete**: A shipyard has completed its current build or refit
- **Mineral Depletion**: A mineral deposit has been exhausted
- **Fuel Status Warnings**: Ships or colonies running low on fuel
- **Population Growth Milestone**: A colony has reached a significant population threshold

**Colony Events:**

- **Colony Established**: A new colony has been founded on a body
- **Terraforming Progress**: Atmospheric changes from terraforming operations
- **Infrastructure Alerts**: Issues with colony infrastructure (overcrowding, supply shortages)
- **Unrest / Stability**: Political stability changes in colonies

**Commander Events:**

- **Promotion**: A commander has been promoted based on experience
- **Retirement/Death**: A commander has left service
- **New Commander Available**: A new officer, scientist, or administrator has joined your pool
- **Assignment Changes**: Automatic reassignments or expiring assignments

**Diplomatic Events:**

- **First Contact**: Communication established with a newly discovered race (see [Section 15.1 Alien Races](../15-diplomacy/15.1-alien-races.md))
- **Diplomatic Status Change**: Relations with another race have shifted (improved or deteriorated)
- **Treaty Offers**: Another race has proposed diplomatic terms
- **Espionage Results**: Intelligence operations have succeeded or been detected

## 3.4.2 Event Display and Colours

Events in Aurora use a colour-coding system to help players quickly identify event types and severity.

**Colour Configuration:**

- Each event type can be assigned custom text and background colours
- Colours are set per-race and persist across game sessions
- The Events Window provides Import/Export buttons for sharing colour configurations (see [Section 3.1 Main Window](3.1-main-window.md))

**Tactical Map Event Display:**
Events can be displayed directly on the tactical map (see [Section 3.2 System Map](3.2-system-map.md) for details). Key features:

- Events on the tactical map use the same text and background colours as the Events Window
- The date and increment length are shown even when no event occurred during the increment
- Double-clicking an event on the tactical map centres the view on the event location

**SM Mode - Multi-Race Events:**
In SpaceMaster Mode, an additional display option shows events for all player races on the tactical map with an extra column identifying which faction each event belongs to.

## 3.4.3 Filtering Events

With potentially hundreds of events generated per time increment (especially in large games), filtering is essential for managing the information flow.

**Filter Controls:**
The Event Log window provides checkboxes or toggles for each event category. You can show or hide:

- Combat events
- Exploration events
- Research events
- Economic events
- Colony events
- Commander events
- Diplomatic events
- Miscellaneous/system events

**Filter Strategies:**

**During Peacetime Development:**

- Show: Research Complete, Construction Complete, Mineral discoveries, jump point discoveries
- Hide: Routine commander promotions, minor colony growth, standard fleet movements
- Focus on: Progress milestones and new opportunities

**During Active Combat:**

- Show: All combat events, hostile contacts, weapon impacts, ship damage
- Hide: Economic events, research completions, routine exploration
- Focus on: Tactical situation awareness

**During Exploration Phase:**

- Show: jump point discoveries, new system entries, survey completions, mineral findings
- Hide: Routine economic production, minor commander events
- Focus on: New territories and resources

**During Economic Build-Up:**

- Show: Construction completions, mineral depletions, fuel warnings
- Hide: Combat events (if no active threats), routine exploration
- Focus on: Production efficiency and resource management

**Time-Based Filtering:**

- The Event Log typically shows events from the most recent time advance
- You can scroll back through historical events
- Very old events may be cleared or archived depending on log size settings

## 3.4.4 Event-Driven Gameplay

Aurora does not actively notify you of most things -- the Event Log is your eyes and ears. Developing an event-driven play style is essential for effective empire management.

**The Event-Check Loop:**
The fundamental gameplay loop in Aurora is:
1. Advance time (choose an appropriate increment)
2. Check the Event Log for anything important
3. Respond to events (give orders, adjust priorities, change plans)
4. Advance time again
5. Repeat

**Interrupt Events:**
Certain critical events automatically interrupt time advancement, stopping the clock regardless of your selected increment:

- Hostile contact detected
- Ship under fire
- Ship destroyed
- Some research completions
- Other configurable triggers

When an interrupt occurs, the time advance stops at that exact moment. This prevents catastrophic events from playing out unmonitored (e.g., an enemy fleet destroying your colony during a 30-day advance). After addressing the interrupt, you can resume advancing time (often at a shorter increment given the new situation).

**Configuring Interrupts:**
You can customize which events trigger interrupts:

- Essential: Always interrupt on hostile contacts and damage events
- Optional: Research completion, construction completion, fleet arrival at destination
- Quality of life: Some players interrupt on mineral discoveries or new commander generation
- Performance: Too many interrupts can fragment long time advances unnecessarily

**Responding to Key Events:**

**"Hostile Contact Detected":**

1. Stop. Reduce time increment to 30 seconds or less (recommended practice).
2. Switch to the system map for the relevant system.
3. Identify the contact (size, speed, bearing).
4. Assess: Is this a threat? Is your fleet in position?
5. Give combat orders if needed or retreat if outmatched.
6. Advance at short increments until the situation resolves.

**"Research Complete":**

1. Open the Research window.
2. Note what was completed -- does this unlock new ship components?
3. Assign the freed scientist to a new project.
4. Consider whether new technology enables better ship designs.

**"Mineral Deposit Exhausted":**

1. Check which mineral was depleted and where.
2. Assess remaining reserves: is this critical?
3. Redirect mining efforts or establish new mining operations.
4. If critical (e.g., Gallicite exhausted), this may require urgent expansion.

**"Construction Complete":**

1. Check what was built (ship, installation, etc.).
2. For ships: Assign to a fleet, give orders.
3. For installations: Verify they are operating as expected.
4. Queue the next construction project if appropriate.

**Building Good Habits:**

- Never advance more than 5-day increments during peacetime without checking events between each advance
- After each advance, scan the log even if nothing seems urgent -- pattern awareness prevents surprises
- If you see multiple "hostile contact" events, something has gone wrong and needs immediate attention
- Keep notes (mental or written) about expected upcoming events: "My ship should arrive at Alpha Centauri in 15 days" -- if it does not, something intervened
- Mineral depletion warnings are not emergencies but should not be ignored -- they represent future bottlenecks

**The Event Log as Narrative:**
Beyond pure gameplay utility, the Event Log tells the story of your empire. A sequence of events like:
> Jump point discovered -> New System Explored -> Hostile Contact Detected -> Weapons Fire -> Ship Destroyed

...tells a story of exploration turned deadly. Many players use the Event Log as the basis for their After-Action Reports, weaving game events into compelling narratives.
