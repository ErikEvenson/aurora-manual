# 3.5 Galactic Map

*Added: v2026.01.24*


## 3.5.1 Overview

The Galactic Map provides a strategic overview of all known star systems and the jump point connections between them. While the System Map (see [Section 3.2 System Map](3.2-system-map.md)) shows the detail within a single system, the Galactic Map displays the broader topology of explored space -- which systems connect to which, where your colonies and fleets are positioned, and how your empire relates to neighboring territory.

**Opening the Window:**

- **F11**: Keyboard shortcut to open the Galactic Map (see [Section 3.3 Common Controls](3.3-common-controls.md))
- **Menu**: Available from the System View / Galactic Map menu entry (see [Section 3.1 Main Window](3.1-main-window.md))

**Window Layout:**

The Galactic Map displays as a node-and-line graph where each node represents a star system and each line represents a jump point connection. The window can be resized and expanded to fill the entire screen for maximum viewing area (see [Section 3.1 Main Window](3.1-main-window.md)).

**Visibility Rules:**

- Only systems your ships have visited appear on the Galactic Map
- Jump point connections are shown only for explored jump points (those your ships have transited)
- In SpaceMaster mode, all systems and connections are visible regardless of exploration status (see [Section 18.5 SpaceMaster Mode](../18-advanced-topics/18.5-spacemaster-mode.md))
- Gravitational survey treaties with NPRs may reveal additional jump point connections in systems both races have explored (see [Section 15.3 Treaties](../15-diplomacy/15.3-treaties.md))

## 3.5.2 Navigation Controls

**Zoom:**

- **Mouse Wheel**: Scroll up to zoom in, scroll down to zoom out
- **Keypad +/-**: Incremental zoom in and out
- Zooming centers on the current view position
- The map scales from showing the entire known galaxy down to individual system clusters

**Panning:**

- **Click and Drag**: Hold the mouse button and drag to pan the view across the galactic map
- The map pans smoothly, maintaining your current zoom level

**System Positioning:**

Systems can be repositioned on the map for visual clarity. The Galactic Map does not represent actual spatial distances -- it is a topological diagram that you can arrange for readability:

- **Shift+Click+Drag**: Grab a system node and reposition it on the map
- **SysPos Button**: An alternative interface for system positioning mode
- Repositioned systems retain their new locations between sessions
- Rearranging systems does not affect gameplay, jump point connections, or travel distances

**Centering:**

- Double-click a system node to center the view on that system
- When centering on a system, the System Map can be switched to display that system simultaneously

## 3.5.3 Display Elements

**System Nodes:**

Each system is represented as a circular node with the system name displayed as a label. Node appearance communicates system status:

| Node Appearance | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| Light green | Populated system (colony present) \hyperlink{ref-3.5-1}{[1]} |
| Green | System with population over 100 million \hyperlink{ref-3.5-1}{[1]} |
| Pale green | Controlled system without colonies of the controlling race *(unverified for C# version)* |
| Red | Hostile alien contact detected in system *(unverified — #721)* |
| Yellow/white | Explored system with no player presence \hyperlink{ref-3.5-3}{[3]} |
| Grey | System known (via jump point discovery) but not yet visited *(unverified — #721)* |

**Jump point connection lines:**

Lines between system nodes represent explored jump point pairs. Each line indicates that ships can transit between the connected systems:

- Standard lines show normal jump point connections
- Military Restricted jump points may display differently when restriction visualization is enabled (see [Section 4.4 Jump Points](../4-systems-and-bodies/4.4-jump-points.md))
- A display option visualizes all restricted connections to help plan civilian trade routes and identify military-only corridors

**Icons Within Nodes:**

System nodes may display small icons indicating the presence of specific assets:

- **Ships**: Military or civilian vessels present in the system
- **Shipyards**: Active shipyard facilities
- **Populations**: Colony indicators
- **Naval Forces**: Military fleet presence (see [Section 16.2 Skills and Bonuses](../16-commanders/16.2-skills-and-bonuses.md) for Galactic Map Naval Forces display)

**Color Coding:**

Body and system colors on the Galactic Map reflect current technology levels. As of v2.4.0, system body colors on the System View window and icons on the Galactic Map account for your current Colonization Cost Reduction technology level \hyperlink{ref-3.5-2}{[2]} (see [Section 7.4 Tech Categories](../7-research/7.4-tech-categories.md)). This means worlds that become viable colonization targets as your technology improves are visually reflected on the map.

**Supernovae Display:**

Systems affected by supernova events display with specialized indicators on the Galactic Map (see [Section 4.1 Star Systems](../4-systems-and-bodies/4.1-star-systems.md)).

## 3.5.4 Sector Assignment

Sectors provide an administrative grouping mechanism for organizing multiple star systems under unified command structures.

**Defining Sectors:**

- Systems can be assigned to named sectors from the Galactic Map interface or via the Sectors window (Ctrl+F9; see [Section 3.3 Common Controls](3.3-common-controls.md))
- A sector consists of one or more star systems grouped for administrative purposes
- Sector boundaries are organizational only -- they do not affect ship movement or jump point access

**Sector Commanders:**

- Each sector can be assigned a sector commander (see [Section 16.2 Skills and Bonuses](../16-commanders/16.2-skills-and-bonuses.md))
- Sector commanders provide administrative bonuses to all colonies and fleets within their sector *(unverified — #721 -- specific sector bonus mechanics not confirmed in available sources)*
- Commander skills (logistics, administration) affect production efficiency and fleet maintenance across the sector *(unverified — #721)*
- Higher-ranked commanders can manage larger sectors more effectively *(unverified — #721)*

**Strategic Use:**

| Sector Strategy | Benefit |
|----------------|---------|
| Geographic grouping | Clusters adjacent systems for logical command structure |
| Functional grouping | Groups mining systems, research systems, or military frontier systems separately |
| Defensive zones | Defines patrol areas and responsibility boundaries for fleet commands |
| Economic regions | Organizes supply chains and trade routes within coherent territories |

> **Tip:** Assign your best administrative commanders to sectors containing your most productive colonies. The compounding bonus across multiple systems can significantly boost empire-wide output.

## 3.5.5 Fleet Disposition

The Galactic Map serves as the primary tool for understanding fleet distribution across your empire at a strategic level.

**Viewing Fleet Positions:**

- System nodes display indicators when fleets are present
- Military and civilian fleet presence may be distinguished by icon type *(unverified — #721 -- icon differentiation not confirmed in available sources)*
- The map provides an at-a-glance view of which systems have naval coverage and which are undefended

**Military vs. Civilian Presence:**

Understanding fleet type distribution helps strategic planning:

- **Military fleets**: Warships, patrol groups, survey vessels on military orders
- **Civilian shipping**: Autonomous freighters, colony ships, fuel harvesters operating under civilian economy rules (see [Section 6.5 Civilian Economy](../6-economy-and-industry/6.5-civilian-economy.md))
- Systems with only civilian presence are vulnerable to raids and require military attention if near hostile territory

**Strategic Planning Use:**

The Galactic Map is essential for late-game fleet management (see [Section 18.4 Late-Game Strategy](../18-advanced-topics/18.4-late-game-strategy.md)):

- Identify gaps in patrol coverage along frontier systems
- Verify logistics chains connect production centers to forward bases
- Plan offensive operations by visualizing the jump point route to target systems
- Assess defensive depth -- how many systems an enemy must transit to reach core territory
- Coordinate multi-fleet operations across several systems simultaneously

**Distance Calculations:**

The Galactic Map provides two distance calculation modes for route planning:

- **Standard Distance**: Calculates the shortest path between systems through all available jump points
- **Distance From Selected System (Restricted)**: Calculates distance while ignoring Military Restricted jump points, showing the true navigable distance for civilian traffic (see [Section 4.4 Jump Points](../4-systems-and-bodies/4.4-jump-points.md) for Military Restricted status)

Both modes can be displayed simultaneously for comparing military vs. civilian route accessibility.

**System Blocking:**

Individual systems can be flagged on the Galactic Map to exclude them from auto-route calculations entirely (see [Section 9.5 Orders](../9-fleet-management/9.5-orders.md)) \hyperlink{ref-3.5-6}{[6]}. This forces the routing algorithm to select alternative paths, useful for avoiding systems with known hostile presence or strategic no-go zones.

**Mineral Search Flags:**

Players can mark individual systems with a "Mineral Search Flag" from the Galactic Map interface \hyperlink{ref-3.5-6}{[6]}. The Mineral Search Window can then restrict searches to flagged systems only, enabling targeted mineral searches within a subset of known space rather than searching all systems simultaneously (see [Section 3.1.7 Mineral Search Window](3.1-main-window.md) for search capabilities).

> **Tip:** Systems with many jump point connections are natural chokepoints with significant strategic value. Identifying and fortifying these systems early prevents enemy forces from penetrating deep into your territory.
