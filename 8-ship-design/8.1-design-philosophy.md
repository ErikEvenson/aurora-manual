# 8.1 Design Philosophy

Ship design is where Aurora's complexity truly shines. The Class Design window lets you combine researched components (see [Section 7.1 Technology Tree](../7-research/7.1-technology-tree.md)) into vessels tailored for specific missions. There is no single "best" design — every ship represents a set of trade-offs between speed, protection, firepower, range, and cost. Understanding those trade-offs before you commit shipyard capacity is the key to building an effective fleet.

## 8.1.1 Role-Based Design

Every ship should be designed with a clear primary role in mind. Attempting to build multi-role vessels that do everything usually results in a ship that does nothing particularly well while costing significantly more than specialized alternatives. Aurora rewards focused design.

**Common ship roles include:**

- **Survey Ships** — Carry geological and/or gravitational sensors. Need long range and reasonable speed, but no weapons. Often the first ships you build.
- **Beam Combatants** — Armed with lasers, railguns, plasma carronades, or other direct-fire weapons. Need fire controls, good speed, and enough armor to survive closing to engagement range.
- **Missile Combatants** — Carry missile launchers, magazines, and missile fire controls. Can engage at extreme range but depend on ammunition supply.
- **Carriers** — Transport fighters or FACs via hangars. Require significant tonnage for hangar space.
- **Scouts** — Fast ships with good sensors to find enemies and provide targeting data. Usually lightly armed or unarmed.
- **Tankers** — Haul fuel to support fleet operations far from home. Commercial engines keep costs manageable.
- **Freighters** — Move cargo, colonists, or troops. Almost always use commercial engines.
- **Jump Ships** — Equipped with squadron jump drives to transit non-stabilized jump points while bringing escorts along.
- **Point Defense Escorts** — Specialized in shooting down incoming missiles with fast-tracking beam weapons and advanced fire controls.
- **Fuel Harvesters** — Equipped with sorium harvesters to collect fuel from gas giants.

**The role determines everything else.** Once you know what a ship is for, the required components become obvious: a survey frigate needs survey sensors and fuel for long-range exploration; a beam cruiser needs weapons, fire controls, good speed, and armor.

**Modular Fleet Composition:**

Rather than building massive multi-role battleships, consider treating each ship class as a functional module within a larger fleet structure. This modular approach offers several advantages:

- **Resource Efficiency:** Do not waste mass on redundancy. If your jump-tender stays out of trouble, your warships do not need to be jump-capable themselves. If your sensor ship handles detection, escorts can focus entirely on weapons.
- **Scalability:** Smaller ships build faster in smaller shipyards, require less maintenance infrastructure at smaller colonies, and simplify technology refits when new components become available.
- **Flexibility:** Fleet capability gaps are addressed by adding specialized modules (a new escort type, a dedicated sensor ship) rather than redesigning existing vessels.
- **Reduced Obsolescence:** When one capability needs upgrading, only that ship class requires a redesign rather than the entire fleet architecture.

A typical modular fleet might include: missile destroyers for offense, AMM frigates for defense, beam escorts for point defense, a jump-capable tender for mobility, tankers for range, a collier for ammunition depth, and a dedicated sensor ship for reconnaissance.

**Tip:** Name your classes descriptively. "Tribal-class Survey Frigate" tells you more at a glance than "DD-7" when you have dozens of designs in your fleet list.

## 8.1.2 Size Considerations

Ship size in Aurora is measured in tons (displayed in increments of 50 tons for most components). Size affects nearly every aspect of a ship's capabilities and limitations.

**Advantages of smaller ships (under 6,000 tons):**

- Cheaper and faster to build, allowing more hulls in service
- Harder to hit (smaller cross-section in combat)
- Can be built in smaller shipyards, requiring less initial investment
- Lower crew requirements reduce officer and manpower pressure
- Losses are less catastrophic — losing one frigate hurts less than losing a cruiser

**Advantages of larger ships (10,000+ tons):**

- More internal space allows more weapons, deeper magazines, bigger sensors
- Can carry thicker armor without crippling speed
- More engineering spaces for better maintenance and damage control
- Room for a full sensor suite (active, passive, fire controls)
- Higher absolute speed potential with larger engines
- Better fuel endurance — larger fuel tanks provide more operational range

**The 1,000-ton threshold:** Ships under 1,000 tons are classified as fighters/FACs and can be built in fighter factories rather than shipyards. However, they cannot carry many components and typically serve specialized roles as part of a larger fleet structure.

**Practical size guidelines:**

- **Scouts and corvettes:** 2,000-4,000 tons
- **Frigates and destroyers:** 4,000-8,000 tons
- **Cruisers:** 8,000-15,000 tons
- **Battlecruisers and battleships:** 15,000-40,000 tons
- **Carriers and flagships:** 25,000-60,000 tons
- **Commercial vessels (freighters, tankers):** 30,000-100,000+ tons

**Tip:** Your first military ships should usually be in the 5,000-8,000 ton range. This provides enough space for meaningful weapons and sensors while remaining affordable for an early-game economy. You can always design larger ships later when your industrial base supports them.

## 8.1.3 Iteration and Obsolescence

Ships do not remain competitive forever. As your technology advances, older designs become outclassed. Managing this obsolescence is a critical part of fleet strategy.

**When to redesign:**

- A major engine technology breakthrough gives significantly better power-to-weight ratios
- New weapon technologies open up different tactical options (e.g., researching mesons or particle beams)
- Sensor improvements make your scouts or fleet escorts inadequate
- Combat experience reveals a weakness in your current designs (insufficient armor, poor fuel range, inadequate point defense)
- You gain access to a new armor type that offers better protection per ton

**Redesign strategies:**

- **Incremental updates:** Create a Mark II of an existing class using the same tonnage and shipyard. The shipyard can refit existing hulls to the new standard, which is faster and cheaper than building from scratch. This works best for modest improvements — swapping in better engines or upgrading fire controls.
- **Clean-sheet design:** When technology has moved far enough that a refit would change more than 50% of the ship, design a new class from scratch. Build a new shipyard or retool an existing one.
- **Generational naming:** Use consistent naming conventions. If your first cruiser class is "Tribal," the next generation might be "Tribal II" or a new name entirely. Some players use a systematic approach: letter prefixes (A-class, B-class) or era markers.

**Managing the transition:**

Old ships do not become useless overnight. A fleet of older destroyers can still patrol quiet sectors, escort freighters, or serve as reserves. Consider:

- Assigning older combat ships to secondary theaters or garrison duty
- Converting obsolete warships to training vessels (they retain crew and provide experience; see [Section 9.3.4 Fleet Training](../9-fleet-management/9.3-task-groups.md))
- Scrapping ships (see [Section 9.2.3 Scrapping](../9-fleet-management/9.2-construction-and-refit.md)) only when maintenance costs outweigh their tactical value
- Using older designs as the basis for new classes by loading the design and modifying it

**Tip:** Do not redesign every class every time you research a new component. Wait until you have a meaningful cluster of improvements, then design a new generation. Constant redesign wastes shipyard time and prevents you from building up numbers. A fleet of adequate ships in service beats a perfect design still on the drawing board.

**Class obsolescence markers:** The game tracks each class's technology date. When browsing your fleet, older classes will show their original design date, helping you identify which ships are falling behind the technology curve.
