# 8.5 Weapons

Weapons in Aurora C# span a broad range of technologies and tactical niches. From long-range missile salvos to devastating close-range plasma bursts, each weapon type rewards different tactical approaches and ship design philosophies. This section covers the major weapon categories and their design parameters.

## 8.5.1 Lasers

Lasers are the most versatile beam weapon in Aurora. They offer good range, respectable damage, and can serve in both offensive and point defense roles. They are often the first beam weapons players invest in heavily.

**Laser types:**

- **Standard Lasers:** The baseline beam weapon. Balanced range and damage.
- **Reduced-size Lasers:** Smaller and lighter versions that sacrifice some range and damage for lower tonnage. Useful for point defense or cramming more weapons onto small hulls.
- **Spinal Mount Lasers:** Larger, more powerful versions that deal additional damage. Only one spinal mount weapon can be installed per ship, but the firepower increase is substantial.

**Laser caliber (size):**

Laser caliber is determined by the focal size, measured in centimeters. Available sizes range from 10cm (the smallest) up to 50cm or larger depending on technology. Larger caliber means:

- More damage per shot
- Longer range
- Heavier weight and larger component size
- Higher power draw

Standard caliber progression: 10cm, 12cm, 15cm, 20cm, 25cm, 30cm, 35cm, 40cm, 50cm, 60cm

**Damage and range:**

Each caliber has a maximum range and a damage value that decreases with distance. Lasers do full damage at close range and reduced damage at maximum range. The damage fall-off is linear:

- At point-blank range: Maximum damage
- At half maximum range: Approximately 75% damage
- At maximum range: 50% damage

Higher wavelength technology (researched in Energy Weapons) extends maximum range without changing the caliber. This means the same 20cm laser will reach further with advanced wavelength tech.

**Wavelength technology:**

The laser wavelength technologies determine maximum beam range:

| Technology | Range Modifier |
|---|---|
| Ultraviolet | 1.0x (base) |
| X-Ray | 1.5x |
| Gamma Ray | 2.0x |
| Near Visible | 0.75x |
| Infrared | 0.5x |

Higher-wavelength techs are strictly better for combat range. Research these as a priority if you use laser-armed ships.

**Reduced-size lasers:**

Reduced-size (RS) technology allows you to build lasers at fractions of their full size. A 25% reduced-size 20cm laser weighs 25% of a full-size 20cm laser, but deals proportionally less damage and has shorter range. The key use case: point defense turrets, where rate of fire and tracking speed matter more than individual shot damage.

**Laser recharge rate:**

Lasers have a recharge time between shots, determined by the Capacitor Recharge Rate technology. Higher recharge rates mean faster firing, which directly translates to more damage per second. This technology applies to all beam weapons, not just lasers.

Recharge rate progression: 1 (base), 2, 3, 4... Each level reduces the time between shots proportionally.

**Tip:** For your first beam warship, 20cm lasers with the best available wavelength technology offer a good balance of range, damage, and size. As your technology improves, consider moving to 25cm or 30cm for main battery weapons while keeping 10-15cm reduced-size lasers for point defense. Do not neglect Capacitor Recharge Rate research — it is effectively a multiplier on all your beam weapon DPS.

## 8.5.2 Railguns and Gauss Cannons

Railguns and gauss cannons are kinetic weapons that fire physical projectiles. They fill different niches than lasers — railguns are heavy hitters at medium range, while gauss cannons are the premier point defense weapon.

**Railguns:**

Railguns fire high-velocity slugs that deal solid damage at medium range. They are simpler than lasers in some respects:

- Damage does not decrease with range (full damage at any distance within maximum range)
- Shorter maximum range than equivalent-tech lasers
- Slightly heavier per unit of damage than lasers
- Available in various calibers similar to lasers

Railgun velocity technology determines maximum range. Higher velocity = longer effective range.

The flat damage profile (no fall-off) makes railguns attractive when you expect to fight at consistent medium ranges. A railgun that deals 10 damage does 10 damage whether the target is at 10,000 km or at maximum range.

**When to use railguns over lasers:**

- When you prefer consistent damage output at predictable ranges
- When facing enemies that try to maintain distance (railgun damage does not diminish)
- As a complement to lasers — mixed batteries give you different range profiles

**Gauss Cannons:**

Gauss cannons are small, rapid-fire kinetic weapons designed almost exclusively for point defense (shooting down incoming missiles). They are the best point defense weapon in the game due to:

- Extremely high rate of fire
- Small size per mount (1 HS per mount)
- Each mount fires multiple shots per fire control cycle
- Multiple mounts can be assigned to a single fire control

Design considerations:
- **Rate of fire:** Determined by technology. Higher Gauss Cannon Rate of Fire tech = more shots per fire control cycle.
- **Size:** Always 1 HS (50 tons) per mount. Very space-efficient.
- **Accuracy:** Uses the beam fire control's tracking speed. Gauss cannons work best with high-tracking-speed fire controls dedicated to point defense.

A single gauss cannon mount fires multiple rounds per cycle. The number of rounds increases with technology, from 1 round at base to 3+ rounds at higher tech levels. Combined with multiple mounts sharing a fire control, this creates a wall of defensive fire.

**Tip:** Every fleet should include gauss cannon-equipped ships for point defense. Even beam-focused fleets need to intercept incoming missiles. A dedicated PD escort with 6-8 gauss cannon mounts and a high-tracking-speed fire control can protect multiple ships in the task group. Do not neglect this — a fleet without point defense is dangerously vulnerable to missile attack.

## 8.5.3 Missile Launchers

Missiles are Aurora's premier long-range weapon system. They can engage targets at ranges far beyond any beam weapon, but they require launchers, magazines, ordnance design, and missile fire controls. The complexity is rewarded with devastating alpha strikes and standoff capability.

**Launcher types:**

- **Standard Launchers:** Reload from magazines after firing. Size ranges from 1 HS to 12 HS (size 1 through size 12 launchers). The launcher size determines the maximum missile size it can fire.
- **Box Launchers:** Fire once and cannot be reloaded in combat. They weigh half of a standard launcher of equivalent size and are cheaper, but once fired they are empty. Excellent for alpha strikes.
- **Reduced-size Launchers:** Take less hull space but reload more slowly. Useful when space is limited.

**Launcher size:**

Launcher size determines the maximum missile size (in MSP — Missile Size Points) that can be fired:

- Size 1 launcher: fires missiles up to size 1 (0.33 HS, ~17 tons)
- Size 2 launcher: fires missiles up to size 2 (0.67 HS, ~33 tons)
- Size 4 launcher: fires missiles up to size 4 (1.33 HS, ~67 tons)
- Size 6 launcher: fires missiles up to size 6 (2 HS, ~100 tons)
- Size 12 launcher: fires missiles up to size 12 (4 HS, ~200 tons)

Larger missiles can carry more fuel, bigger warheads, better seekers, and more agility systems. The trade-off is that larger launchers and missiles take more space and are more expensive.

**Reload rate:**

Standard launchers have a base reload time (typically 30 seconds at starting tech) modified by the Launcher Reload Rate technology. Faster reload means more sustained firepower but does not affect the critical first salvo. Box launchers never reload — they trade sustained fire for lightweight alpha strike capability.

**Magazine-fed operations:**

Standard launchers draw missiles from magazines (see Section 8.6.2). Without magazines, launchers cannot reload. The missile pathway is: Magazine -> Launcher -> Space. Ships must carry enough magazine capacity to support their launchers through an engagement.

**Box launchers vs. standard launchers:**

| Aspect | Standard | Box |
|---|---|---|
| Weight | Full weight | Half weight |
| Reload | Yes (from magazine) | No |
| Sustained fire | Yes | No (single salvo) |
| Magazine needed | Yes | No |
| Best for | Prolonged engagements | Alpha strikes, small ships |

**Missile design (brief overview):**

Missiles themselves are designed in the Missile Design window (covered in detail in Section 12.3). Key missile components:

- **Engine:** Determines speed and fuel consumption
- **Warhead:** Damage on impact
- **Fuel:** Range/endurance
- **Seeker (active or passive):** How the missile finds its target
- **Agility:** Ability to hit maneuvering targets
- **ECM:** Electronic countermeasures to avoid point defense

**Tip:** For early game missile ships, size 4 launchers firing size 4 missiles are a good starting point. They offer enough missile volume for meaningful warheads and seekers without being excessively large or expensive. Box launchers are excellent on small ships (corvettes, FACs) that fire one devastating salvo and then retreat — they do not need magazines, saving significant tonnage on small hulls.

## 8.5.4 Plasma Carronades

Plasma carronades are short-range, high-damage beam weapons. They sacrifice range for devastating close-quarters firepower. Named after historical naval carronades, they follow the same philosophy — get close and obliterate.

**Characteristics:**

- Extremely high damage per shot (significantly more than equivalent-size lasers)
- Very short range (typically 30,000-60,000 km depending on technology)
- Cannot be used for point defense
- Available in multiple calibers like lasers
- Require beam fire controls (same as lasers and railguns)

**Damage output:**

A plasma carronade of equivalent caliber to a laser deals roughly 3x the damage per shot. This makes them the highest damage-per-tonnage beam weapon in the game — if you can close to their engagement range.

**Range limitation:**

The short range is the critical constraint. At starting technology, plasma carronades may only reach 30,000 km. This means:

- Enemy beam ships with lasers will fire on you for tens of thousands of km before you can respond
- You must absorb significant incoming fire while closing the range gap
- Speed is essential — the faster you close, the less time you spend under unanswered fire
- Armor must be heavy enough to survive the approach

**Ideal ship profile for plasma carronades:**

- Fast (to close range quickly)
- Heavily armored (to survive the approach)
- Multiple carronades (to maximize the devastating close-range firepower)
- High-tracking fire controls (targets at close range have high angular velocity)

**Tactical considerations:**

- Plasma ships work best in groups — a single carronade ship rushing a fleet gets destroyed, but a squadron can overwhelm point defense and beam fire
- Combine with ECM to reduce enemy beam accuracy during approach
- Consider pairing with missile ships — missiles force the enemy to deal with incoming ordinance while your plasma ships close
- Against missile-heavy enemies, plasma ships are vulnerable during the long approach

**Tip:** Plasma carronades reward aggressive play. Design your carronade ships with maximum speed and 5-6 layers of armor minimum. The goal is to survive the approach and then deal catastrophic damage once in range. These ships are not for cautious commanders — they are for players who want to close with the enemy and deliver a killing blow at knife-fight range.

## 8.5.5 Mesons and Microwaves

Mesons and microwaves are specialty weapons with unique properties that bypass normal defenses. They fill niche roles but can be devastatingly effective in the right circumstances.

**Meson Cannons:**

Meson cannons are the most unusual weapon in Aurora. They fire meson particles that pass through armor entirely, dealing damage directly to internal components. This completely bypasses the armor protection system.

Key properties:
- Ignores all armor — damage goes straight to internals
- Lower damage per shot than equivalent-size lasers
- Range comparable to lasers (modified by wavelength technology)
- Requires beam fire controls
- Cannot be used for point defense
- Damage is applied randomly to internal components

**When mesons shine:**

- Against heavily armored targets that would shrug off conventional beam fire
- Against enemies with superior armor technology
- For targeted component destruction — even low damage kills internal systems
- Late-game when enemies have very thick armor that other weapons struggle to penetrate

**When mesons are weak:**

- Against lightly armored targets (where conventional weapons would already penetrate easily)
- When raw damage output matters more than armor penetration
- Early game when enemy armor is thin and lasers work fine

**Meson design trade-off:** Meson damage is relatively low but guaranteed to hit internals. A single meson hit might destroy an engine, a fire control, or a magazine — causing cascading failures. Multiple mesons firing on a heavily armored target can systematically strip its internal systems while conventional weapons bounce off the armor.

**Microwave Weapons:**

Microwave weapons target crew rather than ship systems. They pass through armor (like mesons) but instead of damaging components, they kill crew members. Ships that lose all crew are disabled and can be captured.

Key properties:
- Ignores armor
- Kills crew without damaging the ship's structure
- Does not destroy components
- Short-to-medium range
- Ships reduced to zero crew stop functioning (engines stop, weapons cease firing)
- Captured ships can potentially be salvaged or reverse-engineered

**Tactical applications:**

- Capturing enemy ships intact for study (reverse-engineering alien technology)
- Disabling ships without destroying valuable wreckage
- Particularly effective against ships with small crews
- Useless against automated defenses or missile-only opponents (missiles have no crew)

**Combined arms approach:**

Specialty weapons work best as part of a combined-arms fleet:

- Meson-armed ships strip enemy internals while conventional ships hammer armor
- Microwave ships disable enemies once their escorts are destroyed, enabling capture
- Neither weapon type should be your only offensive capability — they complement conventional weapons

**Particle Beams:**

Though not explicitly in this subsection's header, particle beams deserve mention as another advanced beam weapon:

- Higher damage than equivalent lasers
- Shorter range than lasers but longer than plasma carronades
- Cannot be used for point defense
- Available at mid-to-late technology levels

Particle beams occupy the middle ground between lasers (long range, moderate damage) and plasma carronades (short range, extreme damage). They deal more damage than lasers at medium range, making them effective for cruiser-weight combatants that expect to fight at intermediate distances.

**Tip:** Meson cannons are a late-game investment that pays off against heavily armored opponents. If your enemy is building battleships with 8+ armor layers, a squadron of meson-armed cruisers can bypass all that protection and gut their internals. However, against lightly armored targets, conventional weapons are more efficient — mesons sacrifice raw damage for the armor bypass. Build mesons when you need them, not as a default weapon choice.
