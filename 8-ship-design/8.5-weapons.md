# 8.5 Weapons

Weapons in Aurora C# span a broad range of technologies and tactical niches. From long-range missile salvos to devastating close-range plasma bursts, each weapon type rewards different tactical approaches and ship design philosophies. This section covers the major weapon categories and their design parameters.

## 8.5.1 Lasers

Lasers are the most versatile beam weapon in Aurora. They offer good range, respectable damage, and can serve in both offensive and point defense roles. They are often the first beam weapons players invest in heavily.

**Laser types:**

- **Standard Lasers:** The baseline beam weapon. Balanced range and damage.
- **Reduced-size Lasers:** Smaller and lighter versions that sacrifice some range and damage for lower tonnage. Useful for point defense or cramming more weapons onto small hulls.
- **Spinal Mount Lasers:** Larger, more powerful versions that deal additional damage. Only one spinal mount weapon can be installed per ship, but the firepower increase is substantial.

**Laser caliber (size):**

Laser caliber is determined by the focal size, measured in centimeters. Available sizes range from 10cm (the smallest) up to 50cm or larger depending on technology. Larger caliber means:

- More damage per shot
- Longer range
- Heavier weight and larger component size
- Higher power draw

Standard caliber progression: 10cm, 12cm, 15cm, 20cm, 25cm, 30cm, 35cm, 40cm, 50cm, 60cm

**Damage and range:**

Each caliber has a maximum range and a damage value that decreases with distance. Lasers do full damage at close range and reduced damage at maximum range. The damage fall-off is linear:

- At point-blank range: Maximum damage
- At half maximum range: Approximately 75% damage
- At maximum range: 50% damage

Higher wavelength technology (researched in Energy Weapons) extends maximum range without changing the caliber. This means the same 20cm laser will reach further with advanced wavelength tech.

**Wavelength technology:**

The laser wavelength technologies determine maximum beam range:

| Technology | Range Modifier |
|---|---|
| Ultraviolet | 1.0x (base) |
| X-Ray | 1.5x |
| Gamma Ray | 2.0x |
| Near Visible | 0.75x |
| Infrared | 0.5x |

Higher-wavelength techs are strictly better for combat range. Research these as a priority if you use laser-armed ships.

**Reduced-size lasers:**

Reduced-size (RS) technology allows you to build lasers at fractions of their full size. A 25% reduced-size 20cm laser weighs 25% of a full-size 20cm laser, but deals proportionally less damage and has shorter range. The key use case: point defense turrets, where rate of fire and tracking speed matter more than individual shot damage.

**Laser recharge rate:**

Lasers have a recharge time between shots, determined by the Capacitor Recharge Rate technology. Higher recharge rates mean faster firing, which directly translates to more damage per second. This technology applies to all beam weapons, not just lasers.

Recharge rate progression: 1 (base), 2, 3, 4... Each level reduces the time between shots proportionally.

**Tip:** For your first beam warship, 20cm lasers with the best available wavelength technology offer a good balance of range, damage, and size. As your technology improves, consider moving to 25cm or 30cm for main battery weapons while keeping 10-15cm reduced-size lasers for point defense. Do not neglect Capacitor Recharge Rate research — it is effectively a multiplier on all your beam weapon DPS.

## 8.5.2 Railguns and Gauss Cannons

Railguns and gauss cannons are kinetic weapons that fire physical projectiles. They fill different niches than lasers — railguns are heavy hitters at medium range, while gauss cannons are the premier point defense weapon.

**Railguns:**

Railguns fire high-velocity slugs that deal solid damage at medium range. They are simpler than lasers in some respects:

- Damage does not decrease with range (full damage at any distance within maximum range)
- Shorter maximum range than equivalent-tech lasers
- Slightly heavier per unit of damage than lasers
- Available in various calibers similar to lasers
- Fire multiple shots per burst (standard is 4 shots per firing cycle)

Railgun velocity technology determines maximum range. Higher velocity = longer effective range.

The flat damage profile (no fall-off) makes railguns attractive when you expect to fight at consistent medium ranges. A railgun that deals 10 damage does 10 damage whether the target is at 10,000 km or at maximum range.

**Reduced-Shot Railguns:**

Railguns can be designed with fewer shots per firing cycle, ranging from 1 to 4 shots instead of the standard 4-shot configuration. This provides significant size, power, and cost reductions:

- **Power requirements** are reduced in line with the number of shots (a 2-shot railgun needs only half power)
- **Size reduction** follows: 4 shots = 100%, 3 shots = 77.5%, 2 shots = 55%, 1 shot = 32.5% of original size (a 22.5% reduction per shot removed)
- **Cost** is reduced correspondingly due to lower power requirements and recharge rates

Example -- a 20cm railgun with capacitor tech 4:

| Shots | Size (HS) | Power | Cost |
|-------|-----------|-------|------|
| 4 | 7.0 | 12 | 55.4 |
| 3 | 5.43 | 9 | ~42 |
| 2 | 3.85 | 6 | 29.4 |
| 1 | 2.28 | 3 | ~16 |

Reduced-shot railguns are useful when power budget is constrained, when you want a single precise heavy hit rather than a burst, or when designing compact weapons for smaller hulls.

**When to use railguns over lasers:**

- When you prefer consistent damage output at predictable ranges
- When facing enemies that try to maintain distance (railgun damage does not diminish)
- As a complement to lasers — mixed batteries give you different range profiles
- When power budget is limited (reduced-shot variants are power-efficient)

**Gauss Cannons:**

Gauss cannons are small, rapid-fire kinetic weapons designed almost exclusively for point defense (shooting down incoming missiles). They are the best point defense weapon in the game due to:

- Extremely high rate of fire
- Small size per mount (1 HS per mount)
- Each mount fires multiple shots per fire control cycle
- Multiple mounts can be assigned to a single fire control

Design considerations:
- **Rate of fire:** Determined by technology. Higher Gauss Cannon Rate of Fire tech = more shots per fire control cycle.
- **Size:** Always 1 HS (50 tons) per mount. Very space-efficient.
- **Accuracy:** Uses the beam fire control's tracking speed. Gauss cannons work best with high-tracking-speed fire controls dedicated to point defense.

A single gauss cannon mount fires multiple rounds per cycle. The number of rounds increases with technology, from 1 round at base to 3+ rounds at higher tech levels. Combined with multiple mounts sharing a fire control, this creates a wall of defensive fire.

**Tip:** Every fleet should include gauss cannon-equipped ships for point defense. Even beam-focused fleets need to intercept incoming missiles. A dedicated PD escort with 6-8 gauss cannon mounts and a high-tracking-speed fire control can protect multiple ships in the task group. Do not neglect this — a fleet without point defense is dangerously vulnerable to missile attack.

## 8.5.3 Missile Launchers

Missiles are Aurora's premier long-range weapon system. They can engage targets at ranges far beyond any beam weapon, but they require launchers, magazines, ordnance design, and missile fire controls. The complexity is rewarded with devastating alpha strikes and standoff capability.

**Launcher types:**

- **Standard Launchers:** Reload from magazines after firing. Can be created in fractional sizes starting from 1 HS (e.g., 1.1 HS, 2.7 HS). The launcher size determines the maximum missile size it can fire.
- **Box Launchers:** Fire once and cannot be reloaded in combat (see Reloading below for exceptions). They weigh half of a standard launcher of equivalent size and are cheaper, but once fired they are empty. Excellent for alpha strikes.
- **Reduced-size Launchers:** Take less hull space but reload more slowly. All reduced-size technologies are immediately available without research.

**Reduced-Size Launcher Options (updated v2.4.0):**

| Size Multiplier | Reload Penalty | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0.75x | 3x reload time | Moderate size reduction |
| 0.6x | 5x reload time | Significant reduction |
| 0.5x | 10x reload time | Added in v2.4.0 |
| 0.4x | 20x reload time | Major reduction |
| 0.3x | 100x reload time | Extreme reduction |
| 0.15x | 100x reload time | Box launcher (single fire) |

**Launcher size:**

Launcher size determines the maximum missile size (in MSP -- Missile Size Points) that can be fired. Launchers can now be designed in fractional sizes:

- Size 1 launcher: fires missiles up to size 1 (0.33 HS, ~17 tons)
- Size 2 launcher: fires missiles up to size 2 (0.67 HS, ~33 tons)
- Size 4 launcher: fires missiles up to size 4 (1.33 HS, ~67 tons)
- Size 6 launcher: fires missiles up to size 6 (2 HS, ~100 tons)
- Size 12 launcher: fires missiles up to size 12 (4 HS, ~200 tons)

Larger missiles can carry more fuel, bigger warheads, better seekers, and more agility systems. The trade-off is that larger launchers and missiles take more space and are more expensive.

**Reload rate:**

The reload rate formula in C# Aurora is:

```
Reload Time = (SQRT(missile size) * 30 seconds * Reduced Size Modifier) / Reload Rate Tech
```

This means larger missiles take proportionally longer to reload (square root scaling), and reduced-size launchers multiply the reload time by their penalty factor. Faster Reload Rate technology directly reduces the time between salvos.

**Magazine-fed operations:**

Standard launchers draw missiles from magazines (see Section 8.6.2). Without magazines, launchers cannot reload. The missile pathway is: Magazine -> Launcher -> Space. Ships must carry enough magazine capacity to support their launchers through an engagement.

**Box Launcher Reloading:**

Box launchers can only be reloaded in specific locations:

- **Hangars:** Full-speed reloading when docked in a hangar bay
- **Ordnance Transfer Points:** Spaceports, Ordnance Transfer Stations, or Ordnance Transfer Hubs -- reloading at these facilities is 10x slower than hangar reloading

Box launchers cannot be reloaded during combat or while deployed away from these facilities. This restriction prevents box launchers from becoming overpowered given their immediate availability and low size cost.

**Box Launcher Explosion Risk:**

If a box launcher containing a missile is hit by enemy fire, the missile will explode. A technology line reduces the explosion probability:

- Base chance: 100% explosion on hit
- First tech level (1,000 RP): Reduces to 70%
- Final tech level (120,000 RP): Reduces to 5%

**Box launchers vs. standard launchers:**

| Aspect | Standard | Box |
|---|---|---|
| Weight | Full weight | Half weight |
| Reload | Yes (from magazine) | Only at hangars/OTPs |
| Sustained fire | Yes | No (single salvo in combat) |
| Magazine needed | Yes | No |
| Explosion on hit | Magazine detonation risk | Missile explodes if hit |
| Best for | Prolonged engagements | Alpha strikes, small ships |

**Missile design (brief overview):**

Missiles themselves are designed in the Missile Design window (covered in detail in Section 12.3). Key missile components:

- **Engine:** Determines speed and fuel consumption
- **Warhead:** Damage on impact
- **Fuel:** Range/endurance
- **Seeker (active or passive):** How the missile finds its target
- **Agility:** Ability to hit maneuvering targets
- **ECM:** Electronic countermeasures to avoid point defense

**Tip:** For early game missile ships, size 4 launchers firing size 4 missiles are a good starting point. They offer enough missile volume for meaningful warheads and seekers without being excessively large or expensive. Box launchers are excellent on small ships (corvettes, FACs) that fire one devastating salvo and then retreat — they do not need magazines, saving significant tonnage on small hulls.

## 8.5.4 Plasma Carronades

Plasma carronades are short-range, high-damage beam weapons. They sacrifice range for devastating close-quarters firepower. Named after historical naval carronades, they follow the same philosophy — get close and obliterate.

**Characteristics:**

- Extremely high damage per shot (significantly more than equivalent-size lasers)
- Very short range (typically 30,000-60,000 km depending on technology)
- Cannot be used for point defense
- Available in multiple calibers like lasers
- Require beam fire controls (same as lasers and railguns)

**Cost Reductions in C# Aurora:**

Plasma carronades received significant cost reductions in C# Aurora to improve their viability:

- **Development cost halved:** For example, a 30cm Carronade now costs 4,000 RP instead of 8,000 RP
- **Build cost halved:** Construction costs are 50% of the VB6 equivalent

These reductions make carronades a powerful and inexpensive weapon choice, balanced by their very short range requirement.

**Damage output:**

A plasma carronade of equivalent caliber to a laser deals roughly 3x the damage per shot. This makes them the highest damage-per-tonnage beam weapon in the game -- if you can close to their engagement range.

**Range limitation:**

The short range is the critical constraint. At starting technology, plasma carronades may only reach 30,000 km. This means:

- Enemy beam ships with lasers will fire on you for tens of thousands of km before you can respond
- You must absorb significant incoming fire while closing the range gap
- Speed is essential — the faster you close, the less time you spend under unanswered fire
- Armor must be heavy enough to survive the approach

**Ideal ship profile for plasma carronades:**

- Fast (to close range quickly)
- Heavily armored (to survive the approach)
- Multiple carronades (to maximize the devastating close-range firepower)
- High-tracking fire controls (targets at close range have high angular velocity)

**Tactical considerations:**

- Plasma ships work best in groups — a single carronade ship rushing a fleet gets destroyed, but a squadron can overwhelm point defense and beam fire
- Combine with ECM to reduce enemy beam accuracy during approach
- Consider pairing with missile ships — missiles force the enemy to deal with incoming ordinance while your plasma ships close
- Against missile-heavy enemies, plasma ships are vulnerable during the long approach

**Tip:** Plasma carronades reward aggressive play. Design your carronade ships with maximum speed and 5-6 layers of armor minimum. The goal is to survive the approach and then deal catastrophic damage once in range. These ships are not for cautious commanders — they are for players who want to close with the enemy and deliver a killing blow at knife-fight range.

## 8.5.5 Mesons and Microwaves

Mesons and microwaves are specialty weapons with unique properties that bypass normal defenses. They fill niche roles but can be devastatingly effective in the right circumstances.

**Meson Cannons:**

Meson cannons are the most unusual weapon in Aurora. They fire meson particles that pass through shields and armor, dealing damage directly to internal components.

Key properties:
- Bypasses shields and armor -- damage goes straight to internals (with Armor Retardation caveat, see below)
- Cost is based on the same principles as lasers (same cost at equivalent tech level and size)
- Range comparable to lasers (modified by wavelength technology)
- Requires beam fire controls
- Cannot be used for point defense
- Damage is applied randomly to internal components
- Destroys missiles without penalty (missiles are unarmored in C# Aurora)

**Meson Armor Retardation (C# Aurora):**

A new technology line called Meson Armor Retardation provides armor with a chance to stop meson fire. Each layer of armor has an independent probability of stopping the meson based on the defender's retardation technology:

| Tech Level | Chance per Armor Layer to Stop |
|---|---|
| Level 1 | 50% |
| Level 2 | 40% |
| Level 3 | 32% |
| ... | ... |
| Level 12 | 7% |

If armor stops a meson, the meson scores 1 point of damage on the armor at the hit location. Mesons that hit already-damaged armor locations only need to penetrate the remaining armor thickness. This means mesons remain effective against targets with damaged armor even if the defender has high retardation technology.

**When mesons shine:**

- Against heavily armored targets that would shrug off conventional beam fire
- Against enemies with low or no Meson Armor Retardation technology
- For targeted component destruction -- even low damage kills internal systems
- Late-game when enemies have very thick armor that other weapons struggle to penetrate
- Against missiles (automatic destruction, no penalty)

**When mesons are weak:**

- Against targets with high Meson Armor Retardation and thick armor (multiple stop chances per shot)
- When raw damage output matters more than armor penetration
- Early game when enemy armor is thin and lasers work fine

**Meson design trade-off:** Meson damage is relatively low but has a high chance of reaching internals. A single meson hit might destroy an engine, a fire control, or a magazine -- causing cascading failures. Multiple mesons firing on a heavily armored target can systematically strip its internal systems while conventional weapons bounce off the armor. However, the Armor Retardation technology means mesons are no longer guaranteed to penetrate -- thick armor with high retardation tech provides meaningful defense.

**Microwave Weapons:**

Microwave weapons target crew rather than ship systems. They pass through armor (like mesons) but instead of damaging components, they kill crew members. Ships that lose all crew are disabled and can be captured.

Key properties:
- Ignores armor
- Kills crew without damaging the ship's structure
- Does not destroy components
- Short-to-medium range
- Ships reduced to zero crew stop functioning (engines stop, weapons cease firing)
- Captured ships can potentially be salvaged or reverse-engineered

**Tactical applications:**

- Capturing enemy ships intact for study (reverse-engineering alien technology)
- Disabling ships without destroying valuable wreckage
- Particularly effective against ships with small crews
- Useless against automated defenses or missile-only opponents (missiles have no crew)

**Combined arms approach:**

Specialty weapons work best as part of a combined-arms fleet:

- Meson-armed ships strip enemy internals while conventional ships hammer armor
- Microwave ships disable enemies once their escorts are destroyed, enabling capture
- Neither weapon type should be your only offensive capability — they complement conventional weapons

**Particle Beams:**

Particle beams are advanced beam weapons that occupy the middle ground between lasers (long range, moderate damage) and plasma carronades (short range, extreme damage):

- Higher damage than equivalent lasers
- Shorter range than lasers but longer than plasma carronades
- Cannot be used for point defense
- Available at mid-to-late technology levels
- Damage is applied in a single column of armor, providing focused penetration
- Standard size: 300 tons regardless of particle beam strength

**Particle Lance:**

The Particle Lance is a specialized variant of the Particle Beam, designed as a powerful anti-ship weapon requiring significant technological investment.

*Research Requirements:*
- Requires both "Particle Beam Range 200,000 km" and "Particle Beam Strength 6" technologies
- Development cost: 30,000 RP

*Particle Lance Modifiers (compared to standard Particle Beam):*

| Attribute | Modifier |
|---|---|
| Damage | 2x |
| Size | 2x |
| Hit Points | 2x |
| Crew Requirements | 2x |
| Power Requirement | 2.5x |
| Build Cost | 3x |
| Development Cost | 2x |

The Particle Lance applies its damage in a single column of armor, maintaining the constant-damage property of particle beams while enabling superior armor penetration at extended ranges. This narrow penetration profile makes it exceptionally effective against heavily armored targets, as it concentrates all damage into one armor location rather than spreading it across multiple columns.

**Tip:** Meson cannons are a mid-to-late-game investment that pays off against heavily armored opponents, though Meson Armor Retardation technology now provides meaningful defense. If your enemy has low retardation tech and thick armor, mesons remain excellent. Particle Lances are the dedicated armor-cracking alternative -- expensive but devastating against any target. Build mesons when you need to bypass armor cheaply, and Particle Lances when you need guaranteed penetration through focused damage.

## 8.5.6 Turrets

Turrets allow multiple beam weapons to be mounted in a single rotating housing, providing benefits to crew efficiency and gear size while allowing the weapons to track faster-moving targets.

**Multi-Weapon Turret Benefits (C# Aurora):**

The advantages of mounting multiple weapons in turrets have been doubled in C# Aurora compared to VB6:

| Turret Type | Crew Reduction | Gear Size Reduction |
|---|---|---|
| Twin Turret | 20% vs. two individual weapons | 10% gear size reduction |
| Quad Turret | 40% vs. four individual weapons | 20% gear size reduction |

**Turret Armor:**

In C# Aurora, a significant bug from VB6 has been corrected. Previously, turrets required four times more armor than equivalent-sized ships, making armored turrets prohibitively expensive. This has been fixed -- turrets now use the same armor calculations as ships of equivalent size, making armored turrets a viable design option for protecting valuable weapon systems.

**Turret Design Considerations:**

- Turrets increase tracking speed for the weapons mounted within them
- Multi-weapon turrets are more crew-efficient than individual weapon mounts
- Armored turrets protect weapons from damage but add mass
- The gear size reduction in multi-weapon turrets frees up hull space
- Turrets are particularly useful for point defense weapons that need high tracking speed
