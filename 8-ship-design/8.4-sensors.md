# 8.4 Sensors

Sensors are your eyes and ears in space (see [Section 11.1 Thermal and EM Signatures](../11-sensors-and-detection/11.1-thermal-em-signatures.md) for detection mechanics). Without them, your fleet is blind — unable to detect approaching threats, find survey targets, or provide targeting data for weapons. Aurora C# models several distinct sensor types, each designed for a specific detection role. Understanding how they work and how to size them is critical for effective fleet design.

## 8.4.1 Thermal Sensors

Thermal sensors detect the heat signatures generated by ship engines. Every ship with engines running produces a thermal signature, making thermal sensors the most universally useful passive detection system.

**How thermal detection works:**

- Every engine produces a thermal signature proportional to its total engine power
- Ships with engines shut down have a minimum thermal signature based on hull size (crew generates heat)
- Thermal sensors detect engine thermal emissions at ranges determined by sensor sensitivity and target signature strength
- Thermal sensors also detect **planetary thermal emissions** from inhabited worlds, providing an alternative means of discovering alien civilizations alongside EM sensors

**Sensor Size Classification:**

All sensors (thermal, EM, and active) of 1 HS or smaller are classified as **commercial** components. Sensors larger than 1 HS are classified as **military** components. This classification affects maintenance requirements, build costs, and which ship types can mount them without penalty.

**Designing thermal sensors:**

In the Component Design window, thermal sensors are configured with two main parameters:

- **Sensitivity (rating):** Higher sensitivity detects smaller signatures at greater range. Each point of sensitivity increases the detection range. Sensitivity is determined by the sensor technology level researched.
- **Size (HS):** Larger sensors have proportionally better range. A 10 HS thermal sensor detects targets at greater range than a 5 HS sensor of the same technology.

**Detection range formula:**

The detection range for thermal (and EM) sensors uses the following formula:

```
Detection Range (km) = SQRT(Sensor_Strength * Target_Signature) * 10,000
```

Where:

- **Sensor_Strength** = Sensor Size (HS) * Sensitivity Technology Level
- **Target_Signature** = The target's thermal signature value (for thermal sensors) or EM signature value (for EM sensors)

The key relationships are:

- Range increases with the square root of the product of sensor strength and target signature
- Doubling sensor strength increases range by ~41% (square root of 2)
- Doubling target signature also increases range by ~41%
- Better technology provides higher base sensitivity multipliers

**Thermal sensor technology progression:**

The Sensors and Fire Control research category contains passive sensor strength technologies. Each level increases the base sensitivity value, extending detection ranges.

**Practical sizing:**

- **Scouts:** 5-10 HS thermal sensors. These ships exist to find things — invest in sensor size.
- **Warships:** 1-3 HS thermal sensors. Enough for tactical awareness but not a primary role.
- **Survey ships:** 1-2 HS thermal sensors. Minimal — just enough to spot potential threats.

**Thermal vs. EM:** Ships always have a thermal signature when engines are running, making thermal sensors the more reliable detection method against ships in transit. EM sensors are better for detecting active sensor emissions, shield operations, and stationary targets using electronics.

**Tip:** Every combat fleet should include at least one ship with a large thermal sensor. This "eyes of the fleet" ship provides early warning and helps your battle group detect threats long before they reach weapon range. A 10 HS thermal sensor on a fast scout can give you hours of warning against approaching enemies.

## 8.4.2 EM Sensors

Electromagnetic (EM) sensors detect the EM emissions produced by active sensors, shields, and other electronics. While thermal sensors detect engines, EM sensors detect the electronic activity of ships — particularly those using active sensors or running shield generators.

**What EM sensors detect:**

EM sensors detect electromagnetic emissions from the following sources:

- **Active sensor emissions** from ships using radar/lidar (the biggest EM source)
- **Shield generators** when active (shield strength contributes to EM signature)
- **Inhabited planets** -- populations generate detectable EM emissions proportional to their size and industrialization
- **ECCM systems** when active

A ship with no active sensors running and no shields has a minimal EM signature. This makes EM sensors situationally powerful -- they excel at detecting ships that are actively scanning or fighting, but may miss a passive contact. EM sensors are also valuable for detecting inhabited worlds during exploration, providing early warning of alien civilizations.

**Designing EM sensors:**

EM sensors use the same design principles as thermal sensors:

- **Sensitivity:** Determined by research level. Higher sensitivity = better range.
- **Size (HS):** Larger sensors detect at greater range.

The detection range formula mirrors thermal sensors but uses EM signature instead of thermal signature.

**Complementary to thermal:**

The best sensor suites combine both thermal and EM sensors:

- Thermal sensors detect ships in transit (engines running) even if they are electronically quiet
- EM sensors detect ships that are stationary but electronically active (scanning, shields up)
- Together, they cover nearly all tactical situations

**Resolution and identification:**

Passive sensors (both thermal and EM) detect contacts but do not immediately identify them. A thermal contact shows up as "Thermal Contact - Speed XXXX km/s" with an estimated tonnage based on signature strength. You need active sensors or closer range to identify the contact as a specific ship class.

**Tip:** EM sensors are particularly valuable when facing enemies that use active sensors heavily. If an enemy fleet is scanning with powerful search radars, your EM sensors will detect them at extreme range — often before their own sensors detect you. This is a significant tactical advantage: you know they are coming, they do not know you are watching.

## 8.4.3 Active Sensors

Active sensors (radar/lidar) emit energy and detect the reflections. They provide precise targeting data, can determine ship class and composition, and are essential for missile fire control. However, they also broadcast your position to any passive EM sensor in range.

**The active sensor trade-off:**

Using active sensors is always a calculated risk:

- **Benefit:** Precise detection, identification, and targeting data
- **Cost:** Your ship's EM signature spikes dramatically, making it visible to enemy passive sensors at potentially much greater range than your active sensor can detect them

This creates an asymmetric information problem. A ship with active sensors on can be detected by passive EM sensors at ranges far beyond what the active sensor can see. Experienced players often keep active sensors off until they have a reason to turn them on.

**Designing active sensors:**

Active sensors have more design parameters than passive sensors:

- **Size (HS):** Larger sensors have greater detection range. This is the primary range determinant. Sensors of 1 HS or smaller are classified as commercial; sensors larger than 1 HS are military.
- **Resolution:** This determines what size of target the sensor is optimized to detect. A sensor with resolution 100 is optimized for 5,000-ton targets (resolution * 50 = optimal target size in tons). Targets larger than optimal are detected at proportionally greater range; smaller targets at reduced range.
- **Technology level:** Higher Active Sensor Strength technology increases base detection range.
- **Total range:** Displayed in the designer, this is the maximum detection range against a target of optimal size.

**Active sensor sensitivity formula:**

The base sensitivity (GPS -- Gravitational Pulse Strength) of an active sensor is:

```
Active Sensor Sensitivity = Size (HS) * Grav Strength Tech * Sensitivity Multiplier
```

The detection range against a target uses:

```
Detection Range (km) = SQRT(Sensor_Sensitivity * Target_Cross_Section) * 10,000
```

Where Target_Cross_Section is the target's size in HS (tonnage / 50). This means active sensors detect targets based on physical size rather than emissions.

**Resolution targeting:**

Resolution is critical for sensor effectiveness:

- **Resolution 1 (50 tons):** Optimized for detecting missiles. Used on anti-missile fire controls and missile defense sensors. Detects larger ships too, but at the same range regardless of their size.
- **Resolution 10-20 (500-1,000 tons):** Good for detecting fighters and FACs.
- **Resolution 80-120 (4,000-6,000 tons):** General purpose. Detects destroyer-to-cruiser sized ships effectively.
- **Resolution 160-200 (8,000-10,000 tons):** Capital ship detection. Maximum range against large warships.
- **Resolution 320+ (16,000+ tons):** Specialized for detecting very large ships at extreme range.

**Important:** A sensor with resolution 100 detects a 5,000-ton ship at its maximum rated range. A 10,000-ton ship would be detected at approximately 141% of that range (square root of the size ratio). A 1,000-ton ship would be detected at approximately 45% of rated range.

**Active sensor emissions:**

When active, these sensors produce an EM signature equal to their total detection range value. A sensor with 100 million km range produces an EM signature of 100. This means a ship with a 10 HS EM sensor could detect the active sensor's emissions at far greater range than the active sensor can detect the passive ship.

**Sensor modes:**

Active sensors can be set to:

- **Off:** No emissions, no detection. The ship is passive-only.
- **On:** Full emissions, full detection capability.

Fleet commanders typically keep active sensors off during approach and only activate them when combat is imminent or when they need precise targeting data.

**Designing for specific roles:**

- **Fleet search sensor:** Large (10-20 HS), high resolution (100-200), mounted on flagships or dedicated sensor ships. Provides long-range detection of enemy warships.
- **Missile defense sensor:** Small-medium (3-5 HS), resolution 1, designed to spot incoming missiles. Essential for point defense operations.
- **Fire control sensors:** See Section 8.6.1 — these are specialized active sensors that provide targeting data to weapons.

**Tip:** Never put your best search sensor on a ship that operates alone. If that ship is destroyed, you lose your fleet's eyes. Instead, put primary sensors on well-protected ships (or carry redundant sensor ships). Also consider that the ship with the active sensor is the one broadcasting its position — sometimes it is better to have a decoy ship run active sensors while your main fleet approaches passively.

## 8.4.4 Geological and Gravitational Sensors

Survey sensors are specialized instruments used to explore planets, moons, asteroids, and jump points. They have no combat application but are essential for expanding your empire.

**Geological Survey Sensors:**

Geological sensors scan planets, moons, asteroids, and comets for mineral deposits. Without geological survey data, you cannot know what resources a body contains or whether it is worth mining.

Design parameters:

- **Size (HS):** Larger sensors survey faster. A 50 HS geo sensor surveys much more quickly than a 5 HS sensor.
- **Survey speed:** Determined by sensor size and technology level. The survey points generated per time increment determine how quickly a body is fully surveyed.

Survey mechanics:

- Each body has a number of survey points required to complete a geological survey
- Your sensor generates points over time based on its size and the ship's speed (for asteroids/comets that require orbital passes)
- Larger bodies (gas giants, large terrestrial planets) require more survey points
- Asteroids and comets in belts are surveyed individually, requiring the ship to move between them

**Gravitational Survey Sensors:**

Gravitational sensors detect jump points within a star system. Jump points are invisible until a gravitational survey locates them. Without grav survey ships, you cannot expand to new systems.

Design parameters:

- **Size (HS):** Like geo sensors, larger grav sensors survey faster.
- **Survey speed:** Larger sensors accumulate gravitational survey points more quickly.

Survey mechanics:

- Each system has a number of potential jump point locations
- The grav survey ship must traverse the system, accumulating survey points at each potential location
- When enough points are accumulated at a location, any jump point there is revealed
- Survey is complete when all potential locations have been checked (some systems have many jump points, others have few)

**Combined survey ships:**

You can install both geological and gravitational sensors on the same hull. This is common for early-game survey frigates — one ship can both find jump points and survey mineral deposits in new systems. However, specialized ships (one for geo, one for grav) survey faster since they can carry larger individual sensors.

**Survey sensor sizing guidelines:**

- **Minimum viable:** 5 HS sensor. Slow but functional. Appropriate for budget-constrained early games.
- **Standard:** 10-20 HS sensor. Reasonable survey speed for most situations.
- **Fast survey:** 30-50 HS sensor. Quickly surveys systems, allowing rapid expansion. Requires a larger hull to accommodate.

**Tip:** Your first survey ships should carry both sensor types (geo + grav) with at least 10 HS each. This gives you maximum flexibility early on — you can survey jump points and mineral deposits in the same mission. Later, when you have more industrial capacity, build dedicated grav survey ships (faster jump point detection) and dedicated geo survey ships (faster mineral scanning). The time savings add up enormously as your empire expands to dozens of systems.

**Survey commander bonus:**

Officers with the Survey bonus (see [Section 16.3 Assignments](../16-commanders/16.3-assignments.md)) increase survey speed. Assign your best survey-skilled officers to your survey ships for meaningfully faster exploration. This bonus stacks with sensor size, so a good officer on a ship with large sensors surveys very quickly.
