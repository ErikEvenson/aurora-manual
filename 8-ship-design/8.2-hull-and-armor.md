# 8.2 Hull and Armor

The hull defines your ship's size and determines how many components you can install. Armor provides protection against incoming damage but adds significant weight. Together, these two decisions form the foundation of every ship design — get them wrong and no amount of clever weapon selection will save you.

## 8.2.1 Hull Size

Hull size in Aurora C# is measured in tons and determines the total internal volume available for components. The ship designer displays remaining space as you add components, making it straightforward to see how much room you have left.

**Key hull mechanics:**

- Ships are designed in multiples of 50 tons (each "hull space" unit = 50 tons)
- There is no hard maximum size, but practical limits exist based on your shipyard capacity and economy
- The total tonnage of all installed components must not exceed the hull size
- Hull size directly affects the ship's thermal signature (larger ships are easier to detect)
- Hull size determines the cross-section for combat hit calculations (larger ships get hit more often)

**Minimum size considerations:**

- Military ships have no hard minimum but need at least enough space for a bridge, engine, and fuel
- A bridge requires 1 HS (50 tons) and is mandatory on all ships
- The smallest practical warship is around 500-1,000 tons (fighter/FAC range)
- Commercial-engine ships tend to be much larger to offset the lower power density of commercial drives

**The shipyard connection:**

Your shipyard's maximum tonnage determines the largest ship it can build. Expanding a shipyard is expensive and time-consuming, so plan your hull sizes with your shipyard infrastructure in mind. Common early-game shipyard sizes:

- Naval: 6,000-10,000 tons (for frigates and destroyers)
- Commercial: 30,000-50,000 tons (for freighters and colony ships)

**Crew requirements:**

Each component adds to the ship's total crew requirement. Larger ships need proportionally more crew, which means more crew quarters (adding tonnage), more officers (requiring training), and more life support consumables. The bridge itself has a base crew of 5 plus additional crew based on ship size.

**Tip:** When designing your first ships, start with the hull size that your shipyard can handle. There is no benefit to designing a 12,000-ton cruiser if your largest naval shipyard only handles 8,000 tons — you would need to spend years expanding the yard first.

## 8.2.2 Armor Types

Aurora C# features several armor technologies, each unlocked through research. Better armor provides more protection per layer or weighs less per unit of protection.

**Armor technology progression:**

| Technology | Strength per HS | Research Category |
|---|---|---|
| Conventional | 3 | Starting |
| Duranium | 5 | Defensive Systems |
| High Density Duranium | 6 | Defensive Systems |
| Composite | 8 | Defensive Systems |
| Ceramic Composite | 10 | Defensive Systems |
| Laminate Composite | 12 | Defensive Systems |
| Compressed Carbon | 15 | Defensive Systems |
| Biphased Carbide | 18 | Defensive Systems |
| Crystite | 21 | Defensive Systems |
| Absorbium | 24 | Defensive Systems |
| Collapsium | 28 | Defensive Systems |

Each step up in the armor tech tree provides more protection per ton of armor installed. The strength value represents how many damage points each "column" of armor can absorb before the layer is penetrated.

**Armor weight calculation:**

The weight of armor depends on three factors:
- The ship's hull size (larger ships need more armor area to cover)
- The number of layers applied
- The armor technology (higher-tech armor is not lighter — it provides more protection at the same weight)

Armor weight scales with hull size. A single layer of armor on a 10,000-ton ship weighs considerably more than a single layer on a 2,000-ton ship, because there is more surface area to protect.

**Tip:** Research armor technology early. The jump from Conventional (strength 3) to Duranium (strength 5) is a 67% increase in protection for the same weight. This is one of the most impactful early defensive technologies available.

## 8.2.3 Armor Thickness

Armor thickness (number of layers) is one of the most consequential decisions in ship design. Each additional layer provides another row of protection across the entire hull but adds substantial mass.

**How armor layers work:**

Aurora models armor as a grid. The width of the grid is determined by the hull size (specifically, the number of hull spaces). The depth of the grid is the number of layers you select. Each cell in the grid has hit points equal to your armor technology's strength value.

When a weapon hits a ship, it strikes a specific column of armor. The damage must chew through each layer in that column before reaching internal components. This means:

- A weapon dealing 4 damage against Duranium armor (strength 5) will damage but not penetrate even a single layer
- A weapon dealing 6 damage will penetrate the first layer and apply 1 point of damage to the second layer
- Multiple hits to the same column will progressively strip armor until internals are exposed

**Practical armor thickness guidelines:**

- **0 layers:** Only for ships never expected to see combat (survey ships, freighters in safe space). Any hit goes directly to internal components.
- **2-3 layers:** Light protection. Stops small-caliber weapons and missile fragments. Appropriate for scouts, escorts, and destroyers where speed matters more than endurance.
- **4-5 layers:** Moderate protection. A good balance for cruiser-weight combatants. Provides meaningful resistance against medium weapons while keeping the ship reasonably fast.
- **6-8 layers:** Heavy protection. Appropriate for battleships and ships expected to absorb sustained fire. The weight penalty is severe — expect to sacrifice significant speed.
- **9+ layers:** Fortress-level protection. Only practical on very large hulls where the percentage of total tonnage devoted to armor remains manageable. Extremely expensive in terms of mass.

**The weight penalty in practice:**

Consider a 10,000-ton ship with Duranium armor:
- 2 layers might add roughly 1,000-1,500 tons
- 4 layers might add roughly 2,500-3,500 tons
- 6 layers might add roughly 4,000-5,500 tons

These are approximate — the exact figures depend on hull geometry and technology. The point is that armor weight grows linearly with layers but the ship's speed decreases non-linearly as you devote more mass to protection rather than engines.

**Armor vs. speed trade-off:**

This is the fundamental tension in warship design. A heavily armored ship is slow; a fast ship is fragile. There is no universal answer — it depends on your doctrine:

- **Speed doctrine:** 2-3 layers, strong engines, rely on maneuver and range control. Works well with missile ships that never want to close to beam range.
- **Armor doctrine:** 5-6+ layers, accept lower speed, plan to absorb fire while closing to optimal beam range. Works well with short-range beam ships (plasma carronades, particle beams).
- **Balanced:** 3-4 layers with moderate engines. The default choice when you are uncertain what threats you will face.

**Damage distribution:**

Hits are distributed across armor columns based on where on the ship the weapon strikes. The game uses a probabilistic model where center-mass hits are more likely. This means the center columns of armor tend to take more damage than the edges. In prolonged engagements, you may see the center armor stripped away while the edges remain intact — at that point, further center hits go straight to internals.

**Tip:** When facing an unknown threat, 4 layers of the best armor you have is a good starting point for general-purpose warships. You can adjust up or down in future generations once you understand the enemy's weapon characteristics. If they use lots of small-caliber weapons, fewer layers of high-strength armor work well. If they use fewer large-caliber shots, more layers provide the depth to survive individual hits.
