# 8.3 Engines

Engines determine how fast your ships move and how much fuel they burn doing it. Aurora C# offers a deep engine customization system where you choose the base technology, then adjust the size and fuel consumption modifiers to fine-tune performance. Getting engines right is essential — too slow and your fleet cannot dictate engagement terms; too thirsty and it runs dry halfway through a deployment.

## 8.3.1 Engine Technology

Engine power comes from a series of technologies in the Power and Propulsion research category (see [Section 7.4.8 Power and Propulsion](../7-research/7.4-tech-categories.md)). Each new technology level provides a higher base Engine Power per Hull Space (EP/HS), making ships faster without requiring larger engines.

The C# version includes additional early-level technologies compared to VB6 Aurora to smooth out the speed progression in the early game. Conventional engines (available before Trans-Newtonian Technology is researched) produce power at a rate of 0.2 to 1.0 EP/HS, allowing pre-TN civilizations to field slow but functional spacecraft.

**Engine technology progression:**

As of v1.14.0, engine technologies were renamed to eliminate confusion between "Internal Confinement Fusion" and "Inertial Confinement Fusion." The old "Internal Confinement Fusion" level was removed entirely, with all subsequent technologies shifted down one research level. Each technology now has a distinctive name emphasizing its underlying physics, paired with a corresponding power plant technology:

| Drive Technology | Power Plant | EP per HS | Era |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conventional (various) | - | 0.2 - 1.0 | Pre-TN |
| Nuclear Radioisotope Engine | Radioisotope Thermal Generator | - | Pre-TN |
| Nuclear Thermal Engine | Pressurised Water Reactor | 5 | Starting TN |
| Nuclear Pulse Engine | Pebble Bed Reactor | 8 | Early |
| Nuclear Gas-Core Engine | Gaseous Fission Reactor | - | Early |
| Ion Drive | Magnetic Mirror Fusion Reactor | 12.5 | Early-Mid |
| Magneto-Plasma Drive | Stellarator Fusion Reactor | 16 | Mid |
| Magnetic Confinement Fusion Drive | Tokamak Fusion Reactor | 20 | Mid |
| Inertial Confinement Fusion Drive | Inertial Confinement Fusion Reactor | 25 | Mid-Late |
| Solid Core Anti-matter Drive | Solid-core Anti-matter Power Plant | 32 | Late |
| Gas Core Anti-matter Drive | Gas-core Anti-matter Power Plant | 40 | Late |
| Plasma Core Anti-matter Drive | Plasma-core Anti-matter Power Plant | 50 | Advanced |
| Beam Core Anti-matter Drive | Beam Core Anti-matter Power Plant | 64 | Advanced |
| Photonic Drive | Vacuum Energy Power Plant | 80 | Advanced |
| Quantum Singularity Drive | Quantum Singularity Power Plant | 100 | Extreme |

Note: The Ion Drive technology was adjusted from 12 to 12.5 EP/HS and Plasma Core Anti-matter from 60 to 64 EP/HS in C# Aurora to provide smoother progression between levels. The renaming in v1.14.0 added one additional technology tier (Quantum Singularity) at the top while maintaining the same total number of TN-era research tiers by removing the redundant "Internal Confinement Fusion" entry.

**Conventional Reactor (v1.9.0+):**

The Conventional Reactor is a low-power reactor available as an alternative power source for pre-TN or early-TN designs. It produces 25% of the power output of a Pressurised Water Reactor. While significantly less capable than standard TN reactors, it provides a power option for designs that require only minimal electrical generation, such as orbital platforms, space stations, or other vessels where propulsion power is not the primary concern.

**Military vs. Commercial engines:**

Aurora distinguishes between two engine categories:

- **Military engines:** Higher power per ton, smaller size for equivalent thrust, but cost more minerals and BP (build points). Used on warships, scouts, and any vessel that needs performance. Subject to normal maintenance requirements.
- **Commercial engines:** 10x the physical size (in HS) of an equivalent military engine for the same mineral and BP cost. This means they produce far less power per hull space but are dramatically cheaper per unit of size. They also use cheaper minerals. Commercial engines are **exempt from maintenance failures**, making them ideal for long-duration deployments. Mandatory for freighters, colony ships, tankers, and other logistics vessels where speed is secondary to economy and reliability.

The 10x size factor means a commercial engine that costs the same as a 1 HS military engine occupies 10 HS -- providing the same total power output but at a much larger physical footprint. Commercial ships benefit from scale -- their larger hulls can fit bigger engines to partially offset the power-per-HS penalty. A 50,000-ton freighter with commercial engines will still move at a respectable speed if you dedicate enough tonnage to propulsion.

The maintenance exemption is particularly significant for commercial operations: freighters and colony ships on long trade routes never suffer engine failures, eliminating the need for engineering support on routine logistics missions.

**Tip:** Research engine technology as a high priority. Each tier roughly doubles the previous tier's output. A single engine tech advance makes every ship design in your fleet significantly more capable — existing ships can be refitted with new engines, and new designs benefit immediately.

## 8.3.2 Engine Size and Power

When designing an engine component in the Component Design window, you select a size in Hull Spaces (HS) that determines the engine's tonnage and output. This is one of Aurora's most flexible design tools.

**Engine size:**

Engine size ranges from 0.1 HS (for fighters and small craft) up to a maximum determined by your Maximum Engine Size technology. The starting maximum is 25 HS, with a dedicated research line extending this:

| Max Engine Size (HS) | Research Cost (RP) |
|---|---|
| 25 | Starting |
| 40 | 2,000 |
| 60 | 5,000 |
| 100 | 10,000 |
| 160 | 20,000 |
| 250 | 35,000 |
| 400 | 60,000 |

The ability to design engines down to 0.1 HS is particularly important for fighter and small craft design, enabling dedicated ground-support aircraft or micro-fighters with minimal powerplants.

**Engine power output:**

The base EP/HS from your technology is multiplied by the engine size:

- A 1 HS engine using Nuclear Pulse technology (8 EP/HS) produces 8 EP and weighs 50 tons
- A 10 HS engine using the same technology produces 80 EP and weighs 500 tons
- A 25 HS engine produces 200 EP and weighs 1,250 tons

You can install multiple engines per ship. Four 10 HS engines produce the same total power as one 40 HS engine, but with different trade-offs (see below).

**Engine HTK (Hit to Kill):**

Engine durability is calculated as the square root of the engine size in HS:

```
Engine HTK = SQRT(Engine Size in HS)
```

This formula (changed from VB6's linear calculation) means that larger engines are proportionally easier to destroy than multiple smaller engines of equivalent total size. For example:
- A 1 HS engine has 1 HTK
- A 4 HS engine has 2 HTK
- A 9 HS engine has 3 HTK
- A 25 HS engine has 5 HTK
- A 100 HS engine has 10 HTK

The square root formula prevents large engines from functioning as unintended armor (absorbing hits through sheer HTK values). This encourages distributed propulsion designs for combat ships rather than reliance on a single enormous engine.

**Multiple engines vs. single large engine:**

- **Multiple smaller engines:** If one is destroyed, the ship retains partial thrust. Better redundancy. Total HTK across multiple engines is higher than a single equivalent engine (e.g., four 25 HS engines have 4 x 5 = 20 total HTK vs. one 100 HS engine with only 10 HTK).
- **Single large engine:** More space-efficient (one component slot instead of several), but a single hit can cripple the ship's propulsion entirely. Lower total HTK makes it more vulnerable.
- **Combat ships** generally benefit from 2-4 engines for redundancy
- **Commercial ships** often use 1-2 large engines since they are not expected to take fire

**Power ratio modifier:**

The engine designer lets you adjust the power ratio of your engine, which determines the EP output relative to the base technology value. The power ratio can be set within the following ranges:

- **Base range (starting technology):** 50% to 150% of the base EP/HS value
- **Extended range (with tech advancement):** 10% to 300% of base EP/HS value

Higher power ratios increase the engine's EP output but also increase fuel consumption according to a compounding multiplier. The fuel consumption penalty scales with each increment of boost above 100%:

- Each 10% boost above 100% increases fuel consumption by 25% compounding:
  - 110% power: 125% fuel use -- reasonable trade-off
  - 120% power: 156% fuel use -- noticeable fuel penalty
  - 130% power: 195% fuel use -- fuel use nearly doubles
  - 150% power: 305% fuel use -- extreme fuel consumption
  - 200% power: 953% fuel use -- only for very short-range combatants

Conversely, reducing power below 100% decreases fuel consumption, making lower power ratios useful for long-range patrol or survey vessels where speed is less critical than endurance.

**Maximum Engine Power Modifier:**

The Maximum Engine Power Modifier is a separate research line that controls the upper limit of the power ratio available to your engines. Research costs for this line have been halved compared to VB6 Aurora, making higher boost levels more accessible. The Minimum Power Modifier line retains its original research costs and extends the lower bound of the power ratio range.

**Thermal signature:**

Every engine generates a thermal signature proportional to its total power output. This is important because thermal sensors can detect ships by their engine emissions. Higher total engine power = larger thermal signature = easier to detect at range. Ships with engines powered down have reduced thermal signatures.

**Tip:** For most warships, a 10-20% power boost offers a good speed advantage with manageable fuel costs. Anything above 30% should be reserved for ships with very specific short-range missions where fuel endurance does not matter. When choosing engine size, remember that multiple smaller engines provide better combat survivability due to the square root HTK formula.

## 8.3.3 Speed Calculations

A ship's maximum speed is determined by the relationship between its total engine power and its total mass.

**The speed formula:**

```
Speed (km/s) = Total Engine Power / Total Ship Mass (in tons) * 1000 / 0.2
```

More practically: Speed = Total EP * 5000 / Ship Mass (tons)

The key insight is that speed is a ratio — adding more engine power increases speed, but adding more mass (armor, weapons, cargo) decreases it. This is why every component you add to a ship has an indirect impact on performance.

**Factors that affect speed:**

- **Engine power:** Directly proportional. Double the EP, double the speed (if mass stays constant).
- **Ship mass:** Inversely proportional. Double the mass, halve the speed (if EP stays constant).
- **Armor:** Often the largest single mass contributor after engines themselves. Each armor layer significantly reduces speed.
- **Fuel load:** Full fuel tanks are heavy. Ships accelerate faster as they burn fuel, but you cannot count on this tactically.
- **Cargo:** Ships carrying cargo, colonists, or ordnance are slower than when empty.

**Speed classes (rough guidelines with standard tech):**

- **Slow (under 1,000 km/s):** Heavy freighters, fully-loaded colony ships, early-game commercial vessels
- **Moderate (1,000-3,000 km/s):** Escorts, destroyers, reasonably fast cruisers
- **Fast (3,000-5,000 km/s):** Scouts, light combatants, missile boats
- **Very fast (5,000-10,000 km/s):** Interceptors, advanced-tech warships
- **Extreme (10,000+ km/s):** Late-game fighters, specialized chasers

**Fleet speed:**

A task group moves at the speed of its slowest member (see [Section 9.3.2 Task Group Speed](../9-fleet-management/9.3-task-groups.md)). This has profound implications for fleet composition — one slow tanker attached to a fast battle group will drag the entire formation down to tanker speed. Solutions include:

- Designing logistics ships with enough engine power to keep up with combatants
- Using separate task groups for slow and fast ships, rendezvousing at destinations
- Establishing fuel depots so fast combat groups do not need to bring tankers along

**Tip:** When designing a class, check the speed readout in the designer as you add components. If your cruiser has dropped below the speed of your destroyers, your battle group will be limited to cruiser speed. Design your fleet together, not in isolation.

## 8.3.4 Fuel Consumption

Fuel management is a constant concern in Aurora. Ships burn fuel whenever they move, and running out of fuel in deep space leaves a fleet stranded — potentially fatally if enemies are nearby.

**Fuel consumption formula:**

In C# Aurora, both ship and missile engines use a unified fuel consumption formula based on engine size:

```
Fuel Consumption Modifier = SQRT(10 / Engine Size in HS)
```

This replaces the linear fuel consumption model from VB6 Aurora. The key implications:
- A 10 HS engine has a base modifier of 1.0 (the reference point)
- A 1 HS engine has a modifier of ~3.16 (much less fuel-efficient per unit of power)
- A 25 HS engine has a modifier of ~0.63 (significantly more fuel-efficient)
- A 100 HS engine has a modifier of ~0.32 (very fuel-efficient)

This creates a natural efficiency advantage for larger engines and larger ships, while also making the fuel portion of missile engine design more interesting. The formula provides a smooth transition across all engine sizes and allows engines beyond the previous 50 HS limit.

The designer shows fuel consumption in litres per hour at maximum speed. This value, combined with fuel tank capacity, gives you the ship's maximum range.

**Fuel efficiency modifier:**

When designing an engine, you can adjust the Fuel Consumption modifier from 0.1 to 10.0 (in increments of 0.1). This further modifies the base fuel consumption:

- **1.0:** Standard fuel consumption. The baseline.
- **0.5:** Half the fuel consumption but the engine is larger (more HS) for the same power.
- **0.25:** Quarter fuel consumption but much larger engine. Excellent for survey ships needing extreme range.
- **2.0:** Double fuel consumption but smaller engine. Useful when tonnage is at a premium and range is not a concern.

Lower fuel consumption values increase the engine's physical size for the same power output. This is a trade-off — you get better range but the engine takes up more space (and therefore mass), which means you need more fuel savings to offset the larger hull.

**Missile engine fuel consumption:**

Missile engines use the same base formula as ship engines. However, when boost exceeds the maximum racial boost multiplier technology, an additional linear multiplier applies:

```
High Boost Modifier = (((Boost Used - Max Boost Multiplier Tech) / Max Boost Multiplier Tech) * 4) + 1
```

This prevents excessive fuel consumption from becoming trivial while maintaining consistency between ship and missile engine mechanics.

**Range calculation:**

```
Range (billion km) = Fuel Capacity (litres) / Fuel Consumption (litres/hour) * Speed (km/s) * 3600 / 1,000,000,000
```

The ship designer shows range directly, so you do not need to calculate this manually. However, understanding the relationship helps you make informed trade-offs.

**Practical range targets:**

- **System defense ships:** 5-15 billion km (enough to traverse a solar system a few times)
- **Patrol ships:** 30-60 billion km (enough for multi-system patrols)
- **Survey ships:** 80-200+ billion km (must operate independently for years)
- **Freighters and tankers:** 30-100 billion km (need to make round trips between colonies)
- **Long-range exploration:** 150+ billion km (for venturing into unknown space)

**Fuel tank sizing:**

Fuel tanks come in a standard 250-ton size (50,000 litres) but can be customized. The designer allows you to specify tank sizes. More tanks increase range but take up hull space that could be used for weapons or other systems.

A common approach:
- Warships: 15-25% of hull tonnage devoted to fuel
- Survey ships: 25-40% of hull tonnage devoted to fuel
- Freighters: 5-15% of hull tonnage (they carry cargo, not fuel)

**The "bingo fuel" problem:**

Ships do not automatically turn around when fuel reaches 50%. You must manage fuel levels manually or set conditional orders. A ship that burns 60% of its fuel reaching a destination only has 40% to get home — and that assumes a direct return trip. Always plan for:

- The outbound journey
- Time spent on station (patrol, survey, combat maneuvering)
- The return journey
- A reserve margin (10-20%) for unexpected detours or combat

**Tip:** For your first survey ships, err heavily on the side of fuel endurance. A survey frigate that can operate for 2-3 years without refueling saves enormous logistics headaches compared to one that needs a tanker visit every 6 months. Use low fuel consumption modifiers (0.3-0.5) and generous fuel tanks, even if it makes the ship slower.

## 8.3.5 Power Plants

Power plants generate the energy required to recharge beam weapons and power shields. In C# Aurora, power plants were redesigned to eliminate linear power scaling, providing larger reactors with efficiency advantages similar to engine fuel consumption improvements.

**Power output formula:**

Power plant output uses the same square root scaling as engines:

```
Power Output Modifier = SQRT(HS / 10)
```

This means a 10 HS power plant produces the standard (reference) output, while smaller and larger plants scale non-linearly:

| Size (HS) | Relative Output | Practical Effect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | ~32% | Very inefficient; use only when space is critical |
| 5 | ~71% | Below standard efficiency |
| 10 | 100% | Reference output (standard) |
| 20 | ~141% | Good efficiency gain |
| 30 | ~173% | Strong efficiency advantage |
| 50 | ~224% | Maximum practical efficiency |

This scaling means larger ships gain meaningful advantages through reactor scaling, while small ships pay an efficiency penalty for their compact power plants.

**Power plant HTK:**

Like engines, power plant HTK is calculated as the square root of size:

```
Power Plant HTK = SQRT(Power Plant Size in HS)
```

A single large power plant is easier to destroy than multiple smaller ones of equivalent total size, creating the same redundancy trade-off as engines.

**Recharge mechanics:**

Recharge rates remain unchanged from VB6 Aurora. Importantly, larger generators recharge proportionally slower relative to their increased strength. A 40 HS generator producing 200% of standard output requires twice the recharge time compared to a 10 HS standard generator. This means that while large power plants are more space-efficient, they may not be ideal for ships that need rapid weapon cycling.

**Cost and materials:**

- Building costs have been doubled compared to VB6 Aurora
- Power plants exclusively require Corbomite for construction
- The increased cost reflects their enhanced scaling benefits

**Power plant boost technology:**

A separate research line provides enhanced output through boost modifiers. C# Aurora offers double the previous bonus at reduced research costs:

| Boost Level | Additional Output | Research Cost (RP) |
|---|---|---|
| 10% | +10% | 500 |
| 20% | +20% | 1,000 |
| 30% | +30% | 2,000 |
| 40% | +40% | 4,000 |
| 50% | +50% | 6,000 |
| 60% | +60% | 10,000 |
| 70% | +70% | 15,000 |
| 80% | +80% | 20,000 |
| 90% | +90% | 25,000 |
| 100% | +100% | 30,000 |

Higher boost levels carry increased explosion risk when the power plant takes damage. A boosted power plant that is hit has a chance of catastrophic failure proportional to its boost level. This makes boosted reactors a calculated gamble -- particularly suitable for smaller vessels with limited space that need maximum power output from compact reactors, but a liability on ships expected to take sustained fire.

**Tip:** For beam-heavy warships, consider using one large power plant rather than several small ones for space efficiency, but pair it with backup plants for redundancy. The recharge time increase on large plants may matter less for alpha-strike ships that fire once and then maneuver, but rapid-fire beam ships benefit from standard-sized (10 HS) plants with boost applied.
