# 8.3 Engines

Engines determine how fast your ships move and how much fuel they burn doing it. Aurora C# offers a deep engine customization system where you choose the base technology, then adjust the size and fuel consumption modifiers to fine-tune performance. Getting engines right is essential — too slow and your fleet cannot dictate engagement terms; too thirsty and it runs dry halfway through a deployment.

## 8.3.1 Engine Technology

Engine power comes from a series of technologies in the Power and Propulsion research category. Each new technology level provides a higher base Engine Power per Hull Space (EP/HS), making ships faster without requiring larger engines.

**Engine technology progression:**

| Technology | EP per HS | Era |
|---|---|---|
| Nuclear Thermal | 5 | Starting |
| Nuclear Pulse | 8 | Early |
| Ion | 12 | Early-Mid |
| Magneto-Plasma | 16 | Mid |
| Internal Confinement Fusion | 20 | Mid |
| Magnetic Confinement Fusion | 25 | Mid-Late |
| Inertial Confinement Fusion | 32 | Late |
| Solid-Core Anti-matter | 40 | Late |
| Gas-Core Anti-matter | 50 | Advanced |
| Plasma-Core Anti-matter | 60 | Advanced |
| Beam-Core Anti-matter | 80 | Advanced |
| Photonic | 100 | Extreme |

**Military vs. Commercial engines:**

Aurora distinguishes between two engine categories:

- **Military engines:** Higher power per ton, smaller size for equivalent thrust, but cost more minerals and BP (build points). Used on warships, scouts, and any vessel that needs performance.
- **Commercial engines:** Produce only 40% of the power of an equivalent military engine but cost significantly less. They also use cheaper minerals. Mandatory for freighters, colony ships, tankers, and other logistics vessels where speed is secondary to economy.

Commercial ships benefit from scale — their larger hulls can fit bigger (cheaper) engines to partially offset the power penalty. A 50,000-ton freighter with commercial engines will still move at a respectable speed if you dedicate enough tonnage to propulsion.

**Tip:** Research engine technology as a high priority. Each tier roughly doubles the previous tier's output. A single engine tech advance makes every ship design in your fleet significantly more capable — existing ships can be refitted with new engines, and new designs benefit immediately.

## 8.3.2 Engine Size and Power

When designing an engine component in the Component Design window, you select a size multiplier that scales the engine's tonnage and output. This is one of Aurora's most flexible design tools.

**Size multiplier:**

The engine size multiplier ranges from 0.1 to 50 HS (in 0.01 increments). The base EP/HS from your technology is multiplied by the size you choose:

- A 1 HS engine using Nuclear Pulse technology (8 EP/HS) produces 8 EP and weighs 50 tons
- A 10 HS engine using the same technology produces 80 EP and weighs 500 tons
- A 25 HS engine produces 200 EP and weighs 1,250 tons

You can install multiple engines per ship. Four 10 HS engines produce the same total power as one 40 HS engine, but with different trade-offs (see below).

**Multiple engines vs. single large engine:**

- **Multiple smaller engines:** If one is destroyed, the ship retains partial thrust. Better redundancy but takes more internal component slots.
- **Single large engine:** More space-efficient (one component slot instead of several), but a single hit can cripple the ship's propulsion entirely.
- **Combat ships** generally benefit from 2-4 engines for redundancy
- **Commercial ships** often use 1-2 large engines since they are not expected to take fire

**Power boost modifier:**

The engine designer also lets you apply a Power Boost percentage (from 0% to 100% in increments). Each 10% boost increases the engine's EP output by 10% but increases fuel consumption by 25% compounding. This means:

- 10% boost: 110% power, 125% fuel use — reasonable trade-off
- 20% boost: 120% power, 156% fuel use — noticeable fuel penalty
- 30% boost: 130% power, 195% fuel use — fuel use nearly doubles
- 50% boost: 150% power, 305% fuel use — extreme fuel consumption
- 100% boost: 200% power, 953% fuel use — only for very short-range combatants

High boost values are useful for short-range interceptors or system defense ships that operate close to fuel sources. Long-range survey ships and patrol vessels should use little or no boost.

**Thermal signature:**

Every engine generates a thermal signature proportional to its total power output. This is important because thermal sensors can detect ships by their engine emissions. Higher total engine power = larger thermal signature = easier to detect at range. Ships with engines powered down have reduced thermal signatures.

**Tip:** For most warships, a 10-20% power boost offers a good speed advantage with manageable fuel costs. Anything above 30% should be reserved for ships with very specific short-range missions where fuel endurance does not matter.

## 8.3.3 Speed Calculations

A ship's maximum speed is determined by the relationship between its total engine power and its total mass.

**The speed formula:**

```
Speed (km/s) = Total Engine Power / Total Ship Mass (in tons) * 1000 / 0.2
```

More practically: Speed = Total EP * 5000 / Ship Mass (tons)

The key insight is that speed is a ratio — adding more engine power increases speed, but adding more mass (armor, weapons, cargo) decreases it. This is why every component you add to a ship has an indirect impact on performance.

**Factors that affect speed:**

- **Engine power:** Directly proportional. Double the EP, double the speed (if mass stays constant).
- **Ship mass:** Inversely proportional. Double the mass, halve the speed (if EP stays constant).
- **Armor:** Often the largest single mass contributor after engines themselves. Each armor layer significantly reduces speed.
- **Fuel load:** Full fuel tanks are heavy. Ships accelerate faster as they burn fuel, but you cannot count on this tactically.
- **Cargo:** Ships carrying cargo, colonists, or ordnance are slower than when empty.

**Speed classes (rough guidelines with standard tech):**

- **Slow (under 1,000 km/s):** Heavy freighters, fully-loaded colony ships, early-game commercial vessels
- **Moderate (1,000-3,000 km/s):** Escorts, destroyers, reasonably fast cruisers
- **Fast (3,000-5,000 km/s):** Scouts, light combatants, missile boats
- **Very fast (5,000-10,000 km/s):** Interceptors, advanced-tech warships
- **Extreme (10,000+ km/s):** Late-game fighters, specialized chasers

**Fleet speed:**

A task group moves at the speed of its slowest member. This has profound implications for fleet composition — one slow tanker attached to a fast battle group will drag the entire formation down to tanker speed. Solutions include:

- Designing logistics ships with enough engine power to keep up with combatants
- Using separate task groups for slow and fast ships, rendezvousing at destinations
- Establishing fuel depots so fast combat groups do not need to bring tankers along

**Tip:** When designing a class, check the speed readout in the designer as you add components. If your cruiser has dropped below the speed of your destroyers, your battle group will be limited to cruiser speed. Design your fleet together, not in isolation.

## 8.3.4 Fuel Consumption

Fuel management is a constant concern in Aurora. Ships burn fuel whenever they move, and running out of fuel in deep space leaves a fleet stranded — potentially fatally if enemies are nearby.

**Fuel consumption formula:**

Fuel use is calculated per hour of travel and depends on:
- Engine power (higher power = more fuel burned)
- Fuel consumption modifier (the efficiency rating of the engine design)
- Number of engines

The designer shows fuel consumption in litres per hour at maximum speed. This value, combined with fuel tank capacity, gives you the ship's maximum range.

**Fuel efficiency modifier:**

When designing an engine, you can adjust the Fuel Consumption modifier from 0.1 to 10.0 (in increments of 0.1). This modifies fuel use:

- **1.0:** Standard fuel consumption. The baseline.
- **0.5:** Half the fuel consumption but the engine is larger (more HS) for the same power.
- **0.25:** Quarter fuel consumption but much larger engine. Excellent for survey ships needing extreme range.
- **2.0:** Double fuel consumption but smaller engine. Useful when tonnage is at a premium and range is not a concern.

Lower fuel consumption values increase the engine's physical size for the same power output. This is a trade-off — you get better range but the engine takes up more space (and therefore mass), which means you need more fuel savings to offset the larger hull.

**Range calculation:**

```
Range (billion km) = Fuel Capacity (litres) / Fuel Consumption (litres/hour) * Speed (km/s) * 3600 / 1,000,000,000
```

The ship designer shows range directly, so you do not need to calculate this manually. However, understanding the relationship helps you make informed trade-offs.

**Practical range targets:**

- **System defense ships:** 5-15 billion km (enough to traverse a solar system a few times)
- **Patrol ships:** 30-60 billion km (enough for multi-system patrols)
- **Survey ships:** 80-200+ billion km (must operate independently for years)
- **Freighters and tankers:** 30-100 billion km (need to make round trips between colonies)
- **Long-range exploration:** 150+ billion km (for venturing into unknown space)

**Fuel tank sizing:**

Fuel tanks come in a standard 250-ton size (50,000 litres) but can be customized. The designer allows you to specify tank sizes. More tanks increase range but take up hull space that could be used for weapons or other systems.

A common approach:
- Warships: 15-25% of hull tonnage devoted to fuel
- Survey ships: 25-40% of hull tonnage devoted to fuel
- Freighters: 5-15% of hull tonnage (they carry cargo, not fuel)

**The "bingo fuel" problem:**

Ships do not automatically turn around when fuel reaches 50%. You must manage fuel levels manually or set conditional orders. A ship that burns 60% of its fuel reaching a destination only has 40% to get home — and that assumes a direct return trip. Always plan for:

- The outbound journey
- Time spent on station (patrol, survey, combat maneuvering)
- The return journey
- A reserve margin (10-20%) for unexpected detours or combat

**Tip:** For your first survey ships, err heavily on the side of fuel endurance. A survey frigate that can operate for 2-3 years without refueling saves enormous logistics headaches compared to one that needs a tanker visit every 6 months. Use low fuel consumption modifiers (0.3-0.5) and generous fuel tanks, even if it makes the ship slower.
