# 8.6 Other Components

Beyond weapons, sensors, and engines, ships require a variety of support systems to function effectively. Fire controls direct weapons, magazines store ammunition, hangars house fighters, and engineering spaces keep everything running. This section covers the essential support components that complete a ship design.

## 8.6.1 Fire Controls

Fire controls are the targeting systems that direct weapons onto targets. Without a fire control assigned, weapons cannot fire. Aurora C# uses two distinct fire control types: beam fire controls (for direct-fire weapons) and missile fire controls (for missile launchers).

**Beam Fire Controls (BFC):**

Beam fire controls direct lasers, railguns, plasma carronades, gauss cannons, mesons, particle beams, and microwave weapons. Each BFC can control multiple weapons simultaneously, but all weapons assigned to one fire control must fire at the same target.

Design parameters:
- **Range:** Maximum distance at which the fire control can target. Researched via Fire Control Speed technology. A BFC with 100,000 km range cannot engage targets beyond that distance regardless of weapon range.
- **Tracking Speed:** How fast the fire control can follow a moving target. Crucial for hitting fast-moving ships and essential for point defense. Measured in km/s — the fire control can accurately track targets moving at up to this speed relative to your ship.
- **Size:** Typically 1 HS (50 tons). Some technologies allow reduced-size fire controls.

**Tracking speed and hit probability:**

The hit probability of beam weapons depends on the ratio between the fire control's tracking speed and the target's actual speed (relative to your ship):

- If tracking speed >= target speed: High hit probability (further modified by range and ECM)
- If tracking speed < target speed: Hit probability decreases proportionally

This makes tracking speed the single most important stat for point defense fire controls (missiles move very fast) and important for offensive fire controls facing fast ships.

**How many BFCs do you need?**

- Each BFC can control unlimited weapons, but they all fire at one target
- Multiple BFCs allow engaging multiple targets simultaneously
- Dedicated PD fire controls should have maximum tracking speed but can have shorter range
- Offensive BFCs should have maximum range to match your weapons

Rule of thumb: One offensive BFC per target you want to engage simultaneously, plus 1-2 dedicated PD fire controls per ship that needs point defense.

**Missile Fire Controls (MFC):**

Missile fire controls provide targeting data to missiles after launch. Unlike beam fire controls, MFCs guide missiles in flight — they determine how many missiles can be directed at targets simultaneously.

Design parameters:
- **Range:** Maximum distance at which the MFC can guide missiles. Beyond this range, missiles go autonomous (using onboard seekers only).
- **Resolution:** Like active sensors, MFCs have a resolution determining what size target they can lock. Resolution 1 = anti-missile (for AMMs), higher resolutions for anti-ship missiles.
- **Number of missile links:** Each MFC can guide a limited number of missiles simultaneously. More links = more missiles per salvo it can handle. This is determined by technology (Missile Fire Control Links).
- **Size:** Typically 1 HS.

**MFC tactical considerations:**

- Each MFC can direct its linked missiles at one target at a time
- If you have 6 launchers but your MFC only links 4 missiles, only 4 fire in a coordinated salvo (the other 2 wait)
- Multiple MFCs allow multi-target engagements and larger salvos
- MFC range should exceed your missile's fuel range (otherwise the MFC becomes the limiting factor)

**Tip:** Do not under-invest in fire controls. A ship with 8 lasers and only 1 fire control can only shoot at one target — all 8 lasers focus on the same ship. For flexible engagement, carry 2-3 BFCs so you can split fire. For missile ships, ensure your MFC links match or exceed your total number of launchers to avoid wasted launch capacity.

## 8.6.2 Magazines

Magazines store missiles for use by standard launchers. Without magazines, standard launchers cannot reload after their initial salvo. Magazine capacity and placement are critical for sustained missile combat.

**Magazine mechanics:**

- Magazines store a set number of missiles based on size
- Standard missile magazines hold missiles of any size up to their internal capacity
- Magazine capacity is measured in MSP (Missile Size Points)
- A size 4 missile takes 4 MSP of magazine space
- Larger magazines (more HS) hold proportionally more missiles

**Magazine sizing:**

Each magazine component has a size in HS. A standard magazine is typically 1 HS and can be scaled up. The feed mechanism connects magazines to launchers — all magazines on a ship form a common pool that any launcher can draw from.

Planning magazine capacity:
- Calculate total launcher capacity (number of launchers * reloads desired)
- Each reload cycle requires one missile per launcher
- For prolonged engagements: 5-10 reloads worth of magazine capacity
- For shorter actions: 3-5 reloads may suffice
- Remember that box launchers do not need magazines

**Magazine example:**

A ship with 6 size-4 launchers wanting 8 reloads needs:
- 6 launchers * 8 reloads * 4 MSP per missile = 192 MSP of magazine capacity

**Magazine explosion risk:**

Magazines are dangerous when hit. If an armor-penetrating shot strikes a magazine, there is a chance of ammunition detonation (magazine explosion). This can cause catastrophic secondary damage or destroy the ship outright. Ways to mitigate:

- More armor layers protect magazines from incoming fire
- Distributing missiles across multiple smaller magazines reduces the chance of losing all ordnance in one hit
- Engineering spaces and damage control can contain magazine fires

**Tip:** For missile-heavy ships, magazine capacity often dominates the tonnage budget. A destroyer carrying 6 launchers with 10 reloads might devote 30-40% of its hull to magazines. Consider whether this sustained-fire capability is necessary. If you expect short, decisive engagements, fewer reloads (and less magazine tonnage) frees space for engines or armor. If you patrol far from resupply, carry deep magazines.

## 8.6.3 Hangars and Parasite Craft

Hangars allow ships to carry, launch, and recover smaller craft — fighters, FACs (Fast Attack Craft), shuttles, and other parasite vessels. Carrier operations add significant tactical flexibility but require substantial hull tonnage.

**Hangar mechanics:**

- Hangar space is measured in HS, with each HS of hangar accommodating a proportional tonnage of carried craft
- Fighters/FACs land in hangars for maintenance, crew rest, and refueling
- Ships in hangars are protected from combat damage until the carrier itself is hit
- Launching and recovering craft takes time — carriers are not instant-deploy

**Hangar sizing:**

The hangar size needed depends on what you want to carry:

- A 500-ton fighter requires 10 HS of hangar space
- A 1,000-ton FAC requires 20 HS of hangar space
- Carrying a squadron of 6 fighters at 500 tons each needs 60 HS of hangar

This means carriers must be very large ships to carry meaningful fighter groups. A carrier with 12 fighters needs approximately 120 HS (6,000 tons) of hangar space alone, before engines, armor, sensors, or anything else.

**Fighter/FAC design considerations:**

Parasite craft (under 1,000 tons) are designed in the same Class Design window but:
- They can be built in fighter factories (much faster and cheaper than shipyard construction)
- They use military engines by default
- They typically lack the space for full sensor suites or deep magazines
- They depend on their carrier for maintenance, fuel, and ordnance resupply

Common fighter configurations:
- **Missile fighters:** Box launchers with 1-2 anti-ship missiles. Fire and return to carrier for rearming.
- **Beam fighters:** Small lasers or particle beams for close-range attacks.
- **Interceptors:** Fast, with anti-missile weaponry for fleet defense.
- **Bombers:** Larger FACs (500-1,000 tons) with significant ordnance loads.

**Carrier considerations:**

- Carriers need to be fast enough to support fleet operations but are inevitably slow due to hangar mass
- Armor is critical — a carrier hit means its entire air wing is at risk
- Carriers should carry some self-defense weapons (point defense at minimum)
- Consider dedicated maintenance facilities aboard to keep fighters operational

**Maintenance of parasite craft:**

Fighters and FACs require maintenance like any ship. Without hangars (or appropriate maintenance facilities), their maintenance clock ticks down. Once maintenance failures start, fighters become unreliable — they may suffer engine failures during combat or sensor malfunctions during scouting.

**Tip:** Carriers are a major investment. Before committing to carrier operations, consider whether the same tonnage invested in conventional warships would be more effective. Fighters excel at alpha strikes (launching a massive missile volley from multiple small platforms) and scouting, but they are fragile and maintenance-intensive. If you do build carriers, make them large and well-protected — losing a carrier with 12 fighters aboard is a catastrophic loss.

## 8.6.4 Engineering Spaces

Engineering spaces represent the maintenance workshops, damage control stations, and repair facilities aboard a ship. They directly affect how well a ship handles wear, tear, and combat damage.

**Maintenance function:**

All ships accumulate maintenance clock time while deployed. When maintenance is due, components can fail randomly. Engineering spaces extend the time between failures by providing ongoing maintenance:

- The more engineering spaces relative to ship size, the longer between maintenance events
- The standard recommendation is engineering spaces equal to approximately 5-10% of hull tonnage for warships
- Commercial vessels in safe space can get by with less (or none, for short-range ships)

**Maintenance Supply Points (MSP):**

Engineering spaces carry MSP — the consumable resources used for repairs. When a component fails due to maintenance issues, MSP are expended to fix it. When MSP run out, failed components stay broken until the ship is resupplied.

- Ships start deployments with full MSP based on their engineering space capacity
- MSP can be resupplied by supply ships or at colonies with ordnance factories
- Plan MSP capacity based on expected deployment length

**Damage control:**

In combat, engineering spaces serve a second critical function — damage control. When components are damaged or destroyed by enemy fire:

- Damage control teams attempt to repair damaged components
- The number of engineering spaces determines how many repair attempts can be made simultaneously
- More engineering = faster post-battle recovery
- Some components can be repaired in the field; others require a shipyard

**Deployment endurance:**

The practical deployment time of a ship is often limited by maintenance, not fuel. A ship with generous fuel but minimal engineering will start suffering random failures after months of deployment. Plan engineering spaces based on:

- Expected deployment length
- Distance from maintenance facilities
- Acceptable failure risk
- Whether the ship will see combat (combat damage requires more engineering to repair)

**Sizing guidelines:**

- **System defense ships (stay near base):** 3-5% of hull tonnage
- **Patrol ships (6-12 month deployments):** 5-8% of hull tonnage
- **Long-range warships:** 8-12% of hull tonnage
- **Exploration ships (multi-year deployments):** 10-15% of hull tonnage

**Tip:** New players often neglect engineering spaces entirely, then wonder why their ships start falling apart after a year of deployment. Engineering spaces are not glamorous — they do not shoot or scan — but they keep everything else working. For your first warships, 8% engineering is a safe baseline. You can reduce this on ships that will stay close to repair facilities.

## 8.6.5 Fuel Tanks and Cargo

Fuel tanks and cargo holds are the mundane but essential storage components that define a ship's operational endurance and logistical utility.

**Fuel Tanks:**

Fuel tanks store Sorium-based fuel for engine operation. Ships without fuel cannot move — a stranded fleet is a dead fleet.

- Standard fuel tanks: 250 tons (50,000 litres) but can be designed in custom sizes
- Fuel tank size is flexible — design tanks to fill remaining hull space
- Multiple tanks can be installed
- Fuel is consumed during movement at the rate determined by engine design (see Section 8.3.4)

Fuel planning considerations:
- Calculate fuel consumption per hour at maximum speed
- Determine required range for the ship's mission
- Add a 10-20% reserve for unexpected maneuvers
- The ship designer displays range automatically

**Cargo Holds:**

Cargo holds carry minerals, infrastructure, supplies, and other bulk goods between colonies. They are essential for freighter designs.

- Standard cargo holds: Various sizes available
- Cargo capacity measured in tons of material
- Ships with cargo holds appear in the logistics transport lists
- Empty cargo holds do not affect speed (the hold's own weight is counted, not its cargo)
- Loaded cargo holds add mass, reducing speed proportionally

**Cryogenic Transport:**

For moving colonists/population, ships need cryogenic transport modules instead of (or in addition to) cargo holds:

- Each module carries a set number of colonists in suspended animation
- Essential for colony ships
- Colonists do not consume ship supplies during transport
- Modules are relatively large — colony ships tend to be big

**Troop Transport:**

Moving ground forces requires troop transport bays:

- Each bay carries a specific tonnage of ground units
- Troops require more space per unit than cargo (they are alive and need life support)
- Dedicated troopships carry bays plus enough speed to reach contested systems

**Fuel Harvesting Equipment:**

Sorium harvesters collect fuel directly from gas giant atmospheres:

- Installed on ships that orbit gas giants
- Harvest rate depends on module size and gas giant sorium concentration
- Multiple harvesters increase collection rate
- Fuel harvesters fill the ship's own fuel tanks (transfer fuel to tankers for fleet distribution)

**Tip:** When designing freighters and colony ships, maximize cargo/colonist capacity and keep speed reasonable (1,000-2,000 km/s is fine for most logistics). These ships rarely need weapons or sensors — their escorts handle protection. Pour the tonnage savings into more cargo capacity. A 50,000-ton freighter with 40,000 tons of cargo capacity moves twice as much material per trip as one with 20,000 tons of cargo and unnecessary weapons.

## 8.6.6 Jump Drives

Jump drives allow ships to transit jump points that have not been stabilized. Without a jump drive, ships can only traverse jump points that have been stabilized by construction of jump gates. Since jump gates are expensive and time-consuming to build, jump drives are essential for exploration and rapid military response.

**Jump drive types:**

- **Self-only Jump Drive:** Allows only the equipped ship to transit an unstabilized jump point. Cheaper and smaller but limits fleet flexibility.
- **Squadron Jump Drive:** Creates a jump transit window that allows other ships in the same task group to transit as well. More expensive and larger, but enables an entire fleet to move through unstabilized jump points.

**Squadron jump drive capacity:**

A squadron jump drive can transit ships up to a total tonnage limit through the jump point. This limit is determined by the drive's size:

- The jump drive must be large enough to cover the maximum ship size in the task group
- All ships in the task group transit together in one jump (if within the drive's capacity)
- If the task group's total tonnage exceeds the drive's capacity, ships transit in multiple groups

The jump drive size requirement scales with the tonnage of ships it needs to carry. A jump drive rated for 10,000 tons can transit any combination of ships up to 10,000 tons total per jump.

**Jump drive sizing:**

- **Self-only drives:** Much smaller (typically 10-15% of ship tonnage for military drives, less for commercial)
- **Squadron drives:** Must be sized for the expected task group tonnage. A fleet jump ship carrying a 50,000-ton battle group needs a very large drive.
- Jump drive technology improvements reduce the size penalty over time

**Jump sickness:**

Ships transiting unstabilized jump points suffer a brief period of disorientation (jump sickness). During this time, weapons and sensors may not function at full capability. This creates a tactical vulnerability — a fleet jumping into a hostile system is briefly helpless.

- Jump gate transit avoids jump sickness entirely
- Higher-tech jump drives can reduce (but not eliminate) sickness duration
- Defenders at a jump point have a significant advantage over attackers jumping in

**Jump ship doctrine:**

Common approaches to providing jump capability:

- **Dedicated jump ships:** One ship carries a large squadron jump drive. Escorts rely on it for transit. The jump ship itself is usually unarmed (all tonnage goes to the drive). If the jump ship is destroyed, the fleet is stranded.
- **Individual jump drives:** Each ship carries its own self-only drive. More expensive in total tonnage but no single point of failure. Ships can scatter and retreat independently.
- **Mixed approach:** Capital ships carry self-only drives while the fleet jump ship handles escorts and logistics vessels.

**Jump point stabilization alternative:**

Building jump gates at both ends of a jump point stabilizes it permanently, allowing any ship to transit without a drive. This eliminates the need for jump drives but:

- Requires significant construction resources and time
- Both sides of the jump point must be gate-equipped
- Provides a permanent, visible infrastructure that enemies can target
- Best for well-traveled routes; drives are better for frontier exploration

**Tip:** For your first exploration phase, a single squadron jump ship supporting 2-3 survey frigates is the most economical approach. Build jump gates only on your most-traveled routes (home system connections, major colony routes). As your empire grows and jump gate construction becomes affordable, you can phase out jump drives on routine patrol routes and reserve them for frontier and military operations.
