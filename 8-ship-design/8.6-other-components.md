# 8.6 Other Components

Beyond weapons, sensors, and engines, ships require a variety of support systems to function effectively. Fire controls direct weapons, magazines store ammunition, hangars house fighters, and engineering spaces keep everything running. This section covers the essential support components that complete a ship design.

## 8.6.1 Fire Controls

Fire controls are the targeting systems that direct weapons onto targets. Without a fire control assigned, weapons cannot fire. Aurora C# uses two distinct fire control types: beam fire controls (for direct-fire weapons) and missile fire controls (for missile launchers).

**Beam Fire Controls (BFC):**

Beam fire controls direct lasers, railguns, plasma carronades, gauss cannons, mesons, particle beams, and microwave weapons. Each BFC can control multiple weapons simultaneously, but all weapons assigned to one fire control must fire at the same target.

Design parameters:
- **Range:** Maximum distance at which the fire control can target. Researched via Fire Control Speed technology. A BFC with 100,000 km range cannot engage targets beyond that distance regardless of weapon range.
- **Tracking Speed:** How fast the fire control can follow a moving target. Crucial for hitting fast-moving ships and essential for point defense. Measured in km/s — the fire control can accurately track targets moving at up to this speed relative to your ship.
- **Size:** Typically 1 HS (50 tons). Some technologies allow reduced-size fire controls.

**Tracking speed and hit probability:**

The hit probability of beam weapons depends on the ratio between the fire control's tracking speed and the target's actual speed (relative to your ship):

- If tracking speed >= target speed: High hit probability (further modified by range and ECM)
- If tracking speed < target speed: Hit probability decreases proportionally

This makes tracking speed the single most important stat for point defense fire controls (missiles move very fast) and important for offensive fire controls facing fast ships.

**How many BFCs do you need?**

- Each BFC can control unlimited weapons, but they all fire at one target
- Multiple BFCs allow engaging multiple targets simultaneously
- Dedicated PD fire controls should have maximum tracking speed but can have shorter range
- Offensive BFCs should have maximum range to match your weapons

Rule of thumb: One offensive BFC per target you want to engage simultaneously, plus 1-2 dedicated PD fire controls per ship that needs point defense.

**Missile Fire Controls (MFC):**

Missile fire controls provide targeting data to missiles after launch. Unlike beam fire controls, MFCs guide missiles in flight — they determine how many missiles can be directed at targets simultaneously.

Design parameters:
- **Range:** Maximum distance at which the MFC can guide missiles. Beyond this range, missiles go autonomous (using onboard seekers only).
- **Resolution:** Like active sensors, MFCs have a resolution determining what size target they can lock. Resolution 1 = anti-missile (for AMMs), higher resolutions for anti-ship missiles.
- **Number of missile links:** Each MFC can guide a limited number of missiles simultaneously. More links = more missiles per salvo it can handle. This is determined by technology (Missile Fire Control Links).
- **Size:** Typically 1 HS.

**MFC tactical considerations:**

- Each MFC can direct its linked missiles at one target at a time
- If you have 6 launchers but your MFC only links 4 missiles, only 4 fire in a coordinated salvo (the other 2 wait)
- Multiple MFCs allow multi-target engagements and larger salvos
- MFC range should exceed your missile's fuel range (otherwise the MFC becomes the limiting factor)

**Tip:** Do not under-invest in fire controls. A ship with 8 lasers and only 1 fire control can only shoot at one target — all 8 lasers focus on the same ship. For flexible engagement, carry 2-3 BFCs so you can split fire. For missile ships, ensure your MFC links match or exceed your total number of launchers to avoid wasted launch capacity.

## 8.6.2 Magazines

Magazines store missiles for use by standard launchers. Without magazines, standard launchers cannot reload after their initial salvo. Magazine capacity and placement are critical for sustained missile combat.

**Magazine mechanics:**

- Magazines store a set number of missiles based on size
- Standard missile magazines hold missiles of any size up to their internal capacity
- Magazine capacity is measured in MSP (Missile Size Points)
- A size 4 missile takes 4 MSP of magazine space
- Larger magazines (more HS) hold proportionally more missiles

**Magazine sizing:**

Each magazine component has a size in HS. A standard magazine is typically 1 HS and can be scaled up. The feed mechanism connects magazines to launchers -- all magazines on a ship form a common pool that any launcher can draw from.

Planning magazine capacity:
- Calculate total launcher capacity (number of launchers * reloads desired)
- Each reload cycle requires one missile per launcher
- For prolonged engagements: 5-10 reloads worth of magazine capacity
- For shorter actions: 3-5 reloads may suffice
- Remember that box launchers do not need magazines

**Magazine example:**

A ship with 6 size-4 launchers wanting 8 reloads needs:
- 6 launchers * 8 reloads * 4 MSP per missile = 192 MSP of magazine capacity

**Magazine HTK (C# Aurora):**

Magazines in C# Aurora have a base HTK (Hit to Kill) value equal to the square root of their size in HS, rounded down. This is a major change from VB6, where all magazines had a uniform HTK of 1 regardless of size. Larger magazines are now significantly harder to destroy in a single hit.

**Magazine Explosion Mechanics (C# Aurora):**

The explosion system has been completely redesigned:

*Explosion Probability:*
- Base explosion chance is divided by the square root of magazine size
- Example: A 15% base chance becomes ~6.7% for size 5, ~4.7% for size 10, ~3.4% for size 20
- Result: Much rarer explosions on larger vessels

*Chief Engineer Bonus:*
- If the ship has a Chief Engineer, any explosion chance (for magazines or engines) is reduced by the engineer's Engineering Bonus
- Example: 5% base chance with a 30% Engineering Bonus becomes 3.5% actual chance

*Ordnance Loss on Damage:*
- When a magazine is damaged, a proportion of remaining ordnance is destroyed based on: destroyed magazine capacity / total ship magazine capacity
- Destroyed ordnance detonates at full warhead strength
- This is a significant change from VB6, where only excess ordnance exploded at 20% strength
- Result: Far more devastating consequences when explosions do occur

**Magazine Neutralisation System:**

The "ejection" technology from VB6 has been replaced by the Magazine Neutralisation System. It functions identically but represents warhead inactivation during magazine damage events rather than physical ejection of ordnance. This reduces the severity of magazine hits when researched.

**Design Philosophy:**

These changes create a deliberate dynamic: magazine explosions are much rarer on larger vessels (due to higher HTK and reduced explosion probability), but when they do occur, the consequences are far more devastating (full warhead detonation of destroyed ordnance). This rewards careful magazine sizing and makes the Chief Engineer assignment strategically important.

**Commercial Magazines:**

Commercial magazines provide a cheaper but less space-efficient alternative to military magazines. Two models are available:

| Model | Size (HS) | Capacity (MSP) | Cost (BP) | Crew | HTK | Research (RP) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Commercial Magazine - 100 | 12 | 100 | 25 | 5 | 1 | 2,000 |
| Commercial Magazine - 500 | 50 | 500 | 100 | 20 | 1 | 5,000 |

Critical differences from military magazines:
- **100% explosion chance if hit** -- commercial magazines always detonate when struck
- Vulnerable to shock damage even through armor ("one of the magazines could still explode due to shock damage")
- HTK of only 1, making them extremely fragile
- Significantly cheaper in build points per MSP of capacity

Commercial ammunition transports should never be deployed with battle fleets. These vessels are intended purely for logistics and support roles -- resupplying warships at safe rear-area locations.

**Tip:** For missile-heavy ships, magazine capacity often dominates the tonnage budget. A destroyer carrying 6 launchers with 10 reloads might devote 30-40% of its hull to magazines. Consider using larger magazines rather than many small ones -- the square root scaling of both HTK and explosion probability means larger magazines are more survivable. Always assign a skilled Chief Engineer to missile-heavy ships to reduce explosion risk. If you expect short, decisive engagements, fewer reloads frees space for engines or armor. For fleet logistics, commercial magazines on dedicated supply ships offer economical bulk storage -- just keep those ships far from combat.

## 8.6.3 Hangars and Parasite Craft

Hangars allow ships to carry, launch, and recover smaller craft — fighters, FACs (Fast Attack Craft), shuttles, and other parasite vessels. Carrier operations add significant tactical flexibility but require substantial hull tonnage.

**Hangar mechanics:**

- Hangar space is measured in HS, with each HS of hangar accommodating a proportional tonnage of carried craft
- Fighters/FACs land in hangars for maintenance, crew rest, and refueling
- Ships in hangars are protected from combat damage until the carrier itself is hit
- Launching and recovering craft takes time — carriers are not instant-deploy

**Hangar sizing:**

Military hangar bays are 32 HS in size, cost 100 BP, and require 15 crew members. The hangar size needed depends on what you want to carry:

- A 500-ton fighter requires 10 HS of hangar space
- A 1,000-ton FAC requires 20 HS of hangar space
- Carrying a squadron of 6 fighters at 500 tons each needs 60 HS of hangar

This means carriers must be very large ships to carry meaningful fighter groups. A carrier with 12 fighters needs approximately 120 HS (6,000 tons) of hangar space alone, before engines, armor, sensors, or anything else.

**Commercial Hangars:**

Commercial hangars are 50% larger than military hangar bays (48 HS vs. 32 HS), matching military hangars in cost (100 BP) and crew requirements (15). They are intended for:
- Transport of other commercial vessels
- Temporary transport of military vessels
- Reloading of box launchers
- Repairing commercial ships

A critical distinction: military vessels retain their normal maintenance requirements while docked in commercial hangars. This prevents players from using commercial hangars as a maintenance substitute. Commercial hangars are designed for logistics and transport, not for sustained parasite craft operations.

Commercial hangars enable creative logistics solutions such as large ships combining commercial hangar space with maintenance modules, or logistics hubs with multiple vessels providing complementary capabilities.

**Commercial vs Military Hangar Repair Capabilities (v2.0):**

As of v2.0, repair capabilities differ between hangar types due to the introduction of Mobile Repair Bays:

- **Commercial hangars** can only repair commercial ships. Military vessels docked in commercial hangars can perform self-repairs but lose access to the parent ship's damage control rating, cannot repair armour, and must rely on their own maintenance capacity. Maintenance supplies from the parent ship remain available.
- **Military hangars** retain full repair functionality for both military and commercial vessels, including armour repair on both ship types.

**Automated Hangar Resupply (v1.13+):**

Motherships automatically resupply ships in their hangars with Maintenance Supply Points (MSP):
- Conventional technology rate: 10 MSP per hour per ship
- TN technology rate: 20 MSP per hour per ship
- The mothership is treated as having a single virtual cargo shuttle bay for hangar resupply purposes only
- This virtual shuttle bay works on all parasite vessels simultaneously (not limited to one ship at a time)
- The mothership can set a minimum supply amount for itself; no parasite will resupply MSP below that threshold
- The commander's Carrier Operations bonus multiplies the resupply transfer rate

**Automated Hangar Refuelling:**

Motherships also automatically refuel parasites in their hangars, using the same logistics framework as the resupply system. The Carrier Operations commander bonus applies to fuel transfer rates as well.

**Armour Repair in Hangars (v1.13+):**

Motherships automatically repair the armour of ships docked in their hangars:
- On a successful repair attempt, a number of armour boxes equal to the armour strength are repaired
- Armour is restored beginning with the most damaged columns first
- No more than one armour point in a single column is repaired per increment
- Repair uses the same cost structure and probability mechanics as standard component repairs
- This eliminates the need to manually dock damaged parasites at external repair facilities for armour restoration

**Carrier Operations Bonus:**

The Carrier Operations bonus (formerly called Fighter Operations) is a commander attribute that enhances parasite logistics within a carrier's hangar:
- Applies to the rate at which fuel is transferred to hangared parasites
- Applies to the rate at which maintenance supplies are transferred
- Applies to the rate at which ordnance is transferred
- The base transfer rates are multiplied by the commander's bonus value

**Assigned Mothership Display:**

Ships with an assigned mothership show this information in multiple locations:
- The ship design display tab shows the assigned mothership as a dedicated field
- The Fleet tab in the Naval Organization window includes the assigned mothership name and fleet designation
- Strike group achievements are tracked separately with an "(SG)" suffix for the mothership

**Land on Assigned Mothership as Sub-Fleet (v1.10+):**

This movement order operates identically to standard "Land on Assigned Mothership" but preserves fleet identity:
- Landed ships automatically form a new sub-fleet within the carrier fleet
- The sub-fleet adopts the name of the originating fleet (e.g., "Squadron 01" becomes a sub-fleet named "Squadron 01")
- Useful for task forces that need to maintain organizational identity while embarked on larger vessels

**Automated Parasite Assignment:**

This feature (accessible via the Shipyard tab of the Economics window) automates assignment of parasites to newly constructed ships:
- A dropdown menu selects a fleet as the source of parasites for that population
- When a new ship with a designated strikegroup is completed, the system automatically creates a squadron named after the ship with "Strikegroup" appended
- Parasites from the designated source fleet are automatically assigned and landed
- If the full strikegroup complement is unavailable, a partial strikegroup is assigned based on available ships in the source fleet

**Flight Crew Berths:**

In C# Aurora, the ship designer automatically adds 20 flight crew berths for each hangar bay present on a carrier. These berths provide accommodation for crews of parasite warships docked in the carrier's hangars. This eliminates the VB6-era requirement for players to manually calculate and add extra crew space for unknown future parasite configurations.

The berths are assumed to be sufficient for whatever parasite warships are present, providing a standardized capacity rather than requiring precise calculations. Survivors on parasites in hangars transfer to the mothership unless held in cryogenic modules, and the system assumes mothership life support assists docked parasites.

**Fighter/FAC design considerations:**

Parasite craft (under 1,000 tons) are designed in the same Class Design window but:
- They can be built in fighter factories (much faster and cheaper than shipyard construction)
- They use military engines by default
- They typically lack the space for full sensor suites or deep magazines
- They depend on their carrier for maintenance, fuel, and ordnance resupply

Common fighter configurations:
- **Missile fighters:** Box launchers with 1-2 anti-ship missiles. Fire and return to carrier for rearming.
- **Beam fighters:** Small lasers or particle beams for close-range attacks.
- **Interceptors:** Fast, with anti-missile weaponry for fleet defense.
- **Bombers:** Larger FACs (500-1,000 tons) with significant ordnance loads.

**Carrier considerations:**

- Carriers need to be fast enough to support fleet operations but are inevitably slow due to hangar mass
- Armor is critical — a carrier hit means its entire air wing is at risk
- Carriers should carry some self-defense weapons (point defense at minimum)
- Consider dedicated maintenance facilities aboard to keep fighters operational

**Fighter Pods and Fighter Pod Bays:**

Fighter Pods are a flexible ordnance system allowing small craft to carry specialized equipment for ground support and various combat roles. They function as ordnance (built by ordnance factories, transported in magazines) but are non-expendable -- unlike missiles, pods are reusable across multiple combat engagements.

Pod design is done in the Missile Design window with variants including:
- **Bombardment pods:** For ground attack operations
- **Autocannon pods:** For ground strafing
- **Air-to-air pods:** For atmospheric combat

Bombardment pod capabilities follow these formulas:
- Armour penetration = Racial Weapon Modifier * ((Tons / 20) ^ 0.6)
- Damage = Racial Weapon Modifier * ((Tons / 20) ^ 1.6)

Fighter Pod Bays mount on fighter-sized ships and hold only Fighter Pods. They are significantly more space-efficient than box launchers -- fighter pod bays are equivalent in size to the pods they carry, whereas box launchers are three times larger than the missiles (or pods) they fire. Pods require only a minimal-size missile fire control (0.1 HS) to operate.

Different pod types can be assigned to bays while fighters occupy hangars, enabling role-switching without redesigning aircraft. Pods can also load onto standard box launchers, allowing space-combat fighters to support ground operations as needed (though less efficiently).

Ship engines scale down to 0.1 HS in C# Aurora, enabling dedicated ground-support aircraft designs requiring smaller powerplants than space-combat equivalents.

**Maintenance of parasite craft:**

Fighters and FACs require maintenance like any ship. Without hangars (or appropriate maintenance facilities), their maintenance clock ticks down. Once maintenance failures start, fighters become unreliable — they may suffer engine failures during combat or sensor malfunctions during scouting.

**Tip:** Carriers are a major investment. Before committing to carrier operations, consider whether the same tonnage invested in conventional warships would be more effective. Fighters excel at alpha strikes (launching a massive missile volley from multiple small platforms) and scouting, but they are fragile and maintenance-intensive. If you do build carriers, make them large and well-protected — losing a carrier with 12 fighters aboard is a catastrophic loss. Consider fighter pods for ground-support roles -- they provide reusable ordnance that does not require resupply after each engagement.

## 8.6.4 Engineering Spaces

Engineering spaces represent the maintenance workshops, damage control stations, and repair facilities aboard a ship. They directly affect how well a ship handles wear, tear, and combat damage.

**Maintenance function:**

All ships accumulate maintenance clock time while deployed. When maintenance is due, components can fail randomly. Engineering spaces extend the time between failures by providing ongoing maintenance:

- The more engineering spaces relative to ship size, the longer between maintenance events
- The standard recommendation is engineering spaces equal to approximately 5-10% of hull tonnage for warships
- Commercial vessels in safe space can get by with less (or none, for short-range ships)

**Maintenance Supply Points (MSP):**

Engineering spaces carry MSP — the consumable resources used for repairs. When a component fails due to maintenance issues, MSP are expended to fix it. When MSP run out, failed components stay broken until the ship is resupplied.

- Ships start deployments with full MSP based on their engineering space capacity
- MSP can be resupplied by supply ships or at colonies with ordnance factories
- Plan MSP capacity based on expected deployment length

**Damage control:**

In combat, engineering spaces serve a second critical function — damage control. When components are damaged or destroyed by enemy fire:

- Damage control teams attempt to repair damaged components
- The number of engineering spaces determines how many repair attempts can be made simultaneously
- More engineering = faster post-battle recovery
- Some components can be repaired in the field; others require a shipyard

**Deployment endurance:**

The practical deployment time of a ship is often limited by maintenance, not fuel. A ship with generous fuel but minimal engineering will start suffering random failures after months of deployment. Plan engineering spaces based on:

- Expected deployment length
- Distance from maintenance facilities
- Acceptable failure risk
- Whether the ship will see combat (combat damage requires more engineering to repair)

**Sizing guidelines:**

- **System defense ships (stay near base):** 3-5% of hull tonnage
- **Patrol ships (6-12 month deployments):** 5-8% of hull tonnage
- **Long-range warships:** 8-12% of hull tonnage
- **Exploration ships (multi-year deployments):** 10-15% of hull tonnage

**Tip:** New players often neglect engineering spaces entirely, then wonder why their ships start falling apart after a year of deployment. Engineering spaces are not glamorous — they do not shoot or scan — but they keep everything else working. For your first warships, 8% engineering is a safe baseline. You can reduce this on ships that will stay close to repair facilities. For extended deployments, consider supplementing with Maintenance Storage Bays (see Section 8.6.7) to carry additional MSP without adding extra engineering crew.

## 8.6.5 Fuel Tanks and Cargo

Fuel tanks and cargo holds are the mundane but essential storage components that define a ship's operational endurance and logistical utility.

**Fuel Tanks:**

Fuel tanks store Sorium-based fuel for engine operation. Ships without fuel cannot move — a stranded fleet is a dead fleet.

- Standard fuel tanks: 250 tons (50,000 litres) but can be designed in custom sizes
- Fuel tank size is flexible — design tanks to fill remaining hull space
- Multiple tanks can be installed
- Fuel is consumed during movement at the rate determined by engine design (see Section 8.3.4)

Fuel planning considerations:
- Calculate fuel consumption per hour at maximum speed
- Determine required range for the ship's mission
- Add a 10-20% reserve for unexpected maneuvers
- The ship designer displays range automatically

**Cargo Holds:**

Cargo holds carry minerals, infrastructure, supplies, and other bulk goods between colonies. They are essential for freighter designs.

- Standard cargo holds: Various sizes available
- Cargo capacity measured in tons of material
- Ships with cargo holds appear in the logistics transport lists
- Empty cargo holds do not affect speed (the hold's own weight is counted, not its cargo)
- Loaded cargo holds add mass, reducing speed proportionally

**Cargo Shuttle Bays:**

In C# Aurora, large trans-Newtonian ships function only in space and cannot move closer to planetary bodies than low orbit. Cargo Shuttle Bays (replacing the VB6 "Cargo Handling Systems") are required to load or unload cargo at planets.

- Each Cargo Shuttle Bay occupies **10 Hull Spaces**
- A ship must have at least one Cargo Shuttle Bay to load/unload cargo at a planet
- Alternatively, the planet can have a **Spaceport** (3,600 BP) or **Cargo Shuttle Station** (1,200 BP) installation, which counts as one bay equivalent and can service unlimited ships simultaneously

Shuttle technology improves loading performance:

| Technology | Research Cost (RP) | Loading Time Reduction |
|---|---|---|
| TN Shuttles | 5,000 | -2 per bay |
| Improved Shuttles | 15,000 | -3 per bay |
| Advanced Shuttles | 40,000 | -5 per bay |

Base cargo load times in C# Aurora were reduced approximately 45% compared to VB6 (from 36 seconds per cargo point to 20 seconds; colonists from 18 to 10 seconds).

**Cargo Transfers Between Ships:**

As of v2.0, installations and minerals can be transferred between cargo ships or to stations using standing orders:
- Transfer Installation
- Transfer All Installations
- Transfer All Minerals

Each transferring vessel uses its own cargo handling capabilities. However, if the receiving fleet contains at least one cargo shuttle bay, each transferring ship gains access to one additional virtual shuttle bay. This enables deep-space transshipment points where short-range freighters deliver to cargo stations, which then distribute goods via long-range freighters.

**Small Craft Refuelling System:**

The Small Craft Refuelling System (v2.0) is a compact refuelling component designed for operations between small vessels:
- Mass: 50 tons
- Flow rate: 10,000 litres per hour
- Development cost: 5,000 RP
- Can only be mounted on ships of 1,000 tons or less
- Can only refuel ships of 1,000 tons or smaller
- Functions similarly to modern aerial refuelling rather than complex replenishment ships
- Interacts normally with Refuelling Hubs and Colonies
- When tankers with this system are set as conditional order destinations, fleets with ships larger than 1,000 tons will ignore them

**Cargo Holds (Large):**

The Large Cargo Hold is a starting system for both conventional and TN starts in C# Aurora, making cargo capacity accessible from the beginning of any game regardless of starting conditions.

**Cryogenic Transport:**

For moving colonists/population, ships need cryogenic transport modules instead of (or in addition to) cargo holds:

- Each module carries a set number of colonists in suspended animation
- Essential for colony ships
- Colonists do not consume ship supplies during transport
- Modules are relatively large — colony ships tend to be big
- Development cost: 2,000 RP (increased from 1,000 in earlier versions)

When Cryogenic Transport is researched, the following variants are automatically unlocked:
- **Large Cryogenic Transport:** 5x the standard size, 4x cost, 3x crew requirements
- **Small Cryogenic Transport:** Smaller variant for compact vessels
- **Emergency Cryogenic Transport:** Minimal-capacity emergency option

**Troop Transport:**

Moving ground forces requires troop transport bays:

- Each bay carries a specific tonnage of ground units
- Troops require more space per unit than cargo (they are alive and need life support)
- Dedicated troopships carry bays plus enough speed to reach contested systems

When base Troop Transport technology is researched, larger variants are automatically unlocked:
- **Large Troop Transport Bay:** Standard large variant
- **Very Large Troop Transport Bay:** 5x larger than the Large variant, 4x cost, 3x crew
- **Large Troop Transport Drop Bay:** Orbital drop-capable large variant
- **Very Large Troop Transport Drop Bay:** 5x larger drop bay, 4x cost, 3x crew

These automatic unlocks allow players to quickly scale up troop-carrying capacity without additional research overhead.

**Fuel Harvesting Equipment:**

Sorium harvesters collect fuel directly from gas giant atmospheres:

- Installed on ships that orbit gas giants
- Harvest rate depends on module size and gas giant sorium concentration
- Multiple harvesters increase collection rate
- Fuel harvesters fill the ship's own fuel tanks (transfer fuel to tankers for fleet distribution)

**Tip:** When designing freighters and colony ships, maximize cargo/colonist capacity and keep speed reasonable (1,000-2,000 km/s is fine for most logistics). These ships rarely need weapons or sensors — their escorts handle protection. Pour the tonnage savings into more cargo capacity. A 50,000-ton freighter with 40,000 tons of cargo capacity moves twice as much material per trip as one with 20,000 tons of cargo and unnecessary weapons.

## 8.6.6 Jump Drives

Jump drives allow ships to transit jump points that have not been stabilized. Without a jump drive, ships can only traverse jump points that have been stabilized by construction of jump gates. Since jump gates are expensive and time-consuming to build, jump drives are essential for exploration and rapid military response.

**Jump drive types:**

- **Self-only Jump Drive:** Allows only the equipped ship to transit an unstabilized jump point. Cheaper and smaller but limits fleet flexibility.
- **Squadron Jump Drive:** Creates a jump transit window that allows other ships in the same task group to transit as well. More expensive and larger, but enables an entire fleet to move through unstabilized jump points.

**Squadron jump drive capacity:**

A squadron jump drive can transit ships up to a total tonnage limit through the jump point. This limit is determined by the drive's size:

- The jump drive must be large enough to cover the maximum ship size in the task group
- All ships in the task group transit together in one jump (if within the drive's capacity)
- If the task group's total tonnage exceeds the drive's capacity, ships transit in multiple groups

The jump drive size requirement scales with the tonnage of ships it needs to carry. A jump drive rated for 10,000 tons can transit any combination of ships up to 10,000 tons total per jump.

**Jump drive sizing:**

- **Self-only drives:** Much smaller (typically 10-15% of ship tonnage for military drives, less for commercial)
- **Squadron drives:** Must be sized for the expected task group tonnage. A fleet jump ship carrying a 50,000-ton battle group needs a very large drive.
- Jump drive technology improvements reduce the size penalty over time

**Jump sickness:**

Ships transiting unstabilized jump points suffer a brief period of disorientation (jump sickness). During this time, weapons and sensors may not function at full capability. This creates a tactical vulnerability — a fleet jumping into a hostile system is briefly helpless.

- Jump gate transit avoids jump sickness entirely
- Higher-tech jump drives can reduce (but not eliminate) sickness duration
- Defenders at a jump point have a significant advantage over attackers jumping in

**Jump ship doctrine:**

Common approaches to providing jump capability:

- **Dedicated jump ships:** One ship carries a large squadron jump drive. Escorts rely on it for transit. The jump ship itself is usually unarmed (all tonnage goes to the drive). If the jump ship is destroyed, the fleet is stranded.
- **Individual jump drives:** Each ship carries its own self-only drive. More expensive in total tonnage but no single point of failure. Ships can scatter and retreat independently.
- **Mixed approach:** Capital ships carry self-only drives while the fleet jump ship handles escorts and logistics vessels.

**Jump point stabilization alternative:**

Building jump gates at both ends of a jump point stabilizes it permanently, allowing any ship to transit without a drive. This eliminates the need for jump drives but:

- Requires significant construction resources and time
- Both sides of the jump point must be gate-equipped
- Provides a permanent, visible infrastructure that enemies can target
- Best for well-traveled routes; drives are better for frontier exploration

**Tip:** For your first exploration phase, a single squadron jump ship supporting 2-3 survey frigates is the most economical approach. Build jump gates only on your most-traveled routes (home system connections, major colony routes). As your empire grows and jump gate construction becomes affordable, you can phase out jump drives on routine patrol routes and reserve them for frontier and military operations.

## 8.6.7 Maintenance Storage Bays

Maintenance Storage Bays provide additional Maintenance Supply Points (MSP) beyond what engineering spaces carry. They function as dedicated storage for spare parts and repair materials, extending a ship's ability to perform maintenance and damage control during long deployments.

Unlike engineering spaces (which provide both maintenance capacity and MSP storage), maintenance storage bays provide only MSP storage without adding maintenance personnel. This makes them useful for:
- Fleet tenders that resupply other ships' MSP
- Long-deployment warships that need extra repair materials
- Logistics vessels supporting forward-deployed task groups

When designing support ships, combine engineering spaces (for active repair capability) with maintenance storage bays (for extra MSP capacity) to create effective fleet maintenance vessels.

## 8.6.8 Fractional Capacitors

Fractional capacitors are an enhancement to the capacitor technology system that provides intermediate recharge rate options for beam weapons. When each capacitor technology level is researched, fractional (interpolated) capacitor technologies are automatically unlocked.

**How they work:**

Researching a capacitor technology level grants quarter-step intermediate versions automatically. For example, researching Capacitor Tech 2 also unlocks capacitor versions 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75 simultaneously.

**Available levels:**

- Quarter-level technologies (x.25, x.5, x.75) are available up to Capacitor 4
- Additional intermediate levels: 4.5, 5.5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, and 15

**Impact on beam weapon design:**

Since beam weapon costs are primarily determined by power requirement, range modifier, and recharge rate, fractional capacitors enable more cost-effective weapon designs. By selecting intermediate recharge rates that better match specific weapon requirements, designers can avoid over-specifying capacitor levels and reduce unnecessary costs.

For example, if a weapon only needs a recharge rate between Capacitor 1 and Capacitor 2, selecting Capacitor 1.5 provides the needed performance without paying for the full Capacitor 2 cost. This makes some beam weapons slightly cheaper and allows finer optimization of ship power budgets.

**Tip:** When designing beam weapons, always check if a fractional capacitor level meets your recharge needs. A laser with Capacitor 1.75 instead of Capacitor 2 costs less while providing nearly the same fire rate. The savings compound across multiple weapons on a ship.

## 8.6.9 Bridges

Ships of 1,000 tons or more require a bridge component. In C# Aurora v1.14.0, the automatic bridge system was adjusted:

- The design interface indicates when a vessel needs a bridge at 1,000+ tons through an error message
- However, the bridge is not automatically added until the design reaches **1,100 tons**
- This 100-ton buffer allows designers to experiment with systems in the 1,000-1,100 ton range without mandatory bridge installation
- Once designs exceed 1,100 tons, bridges are automatically incorporated without further player intervention

Ships below 1,000 tons (fighters, FACs, and small craft) do not require bridges.

## 8.6.10 Mobile Repair Bays

Mobile Repair Bays (introduced in v2.0) provide forward repair capabilities without requiring planetary infrastructure. They enable ship-based repair yards that can operate anywhere in space.

**Specifications:**

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Size | 2,000 tons per unit |
| Build Point Cost | 120 BP per bay |
| Development Cost | 5,000 RP |
| Repair Capacity | 1,000 tons per bay (stackable) |

**Functionality:**

- When a ship carrying Mobile Repair Bays orbits a population, it appears in that population's shipyard list under the parent ship's name
- The bays can perform repair and scrapping tasks identically to fixed Repair Yards of equivalent capacity
- Require no workers to operate (unlike ground-based Repair Yards)
- Cannot be expanded or modified after construction
- Multiple bays on the same ship stack their repair capacity

**Operational Restrictions:**

- If a ship-based repair yard is actively performing work, the parent fleet cannot receive movement orders
- The fleet remains stationary during all repair operations

**Strategic Applications:**

- Forward-deployed repair bases without colonist support
- Repair capabilities at Deep Space Populations
- Temporary repair facilities at contested locations
- Mobile repair networks throughout explored space
- Ideal for fleets operating far from established infrastructure

**Comparison to Fixed Repair Yards:**

Mobile Repair Bays are slightly more expensive than equivalent fixed Repair Yards for larger capacities, but they eliminate all infrastructure requirements. The trade-off is flexibility versus cost-effectiveness -- fixed yards are cheaper for permanent installations, while mobile bays provide unmatched strategic mobility.

## 8.6.11 Miscellaneous Components

Miscellaneous components are a category of ship modules with no game function, serving entirely for roleplaying purposes. They were introduced in v1.13 to support narrative-focused gameplay.

**Design parameters:**

- Size range: 0.1 HS to 100 HS
- Build point cost: Equal to the component's size in HS
- Mineral requirements: Split between Duranium and Mercassium
- HTK: Equal to the square root of the size (same formula as other components)

**Implementation:**

These components integrate into the standard ship design workflow through a dedicated component type category on the design window. They appear in class summaries alongside functional components but do not affect vessel performance, combat capability, or any game mechanics.

**Example applications:**

- Entertainment Lounges for crew morale (flavour only)
- Viewing Galleries on passenger liners
- Ship Libraries for long-deployment vessels
- Diplomatic suites on embassy ships
- Science labs (decorative, beyond sensor function)
- Chapels, gymnasiums, or other crew facilities

These components allow players who invest in roleplaying elements to enhance immersion through fictional ship amenities, adding character and backstory to their designs without affecting gameplay balance.

## 8.6.12 Ship Class Templates

Ship class templates provide pre-configured starting points for common ship designs in C# Aurora. These templates include appropriate components for their intended role and can be modified freely after selection.

Templates speed up the design process for new players and provide baseline configurations that represent functional (if not optimized) designs for standard roles. Experienced players can use them as starting points and customize from there, or ignore them entirely and design from scratch.
