# 10.1 Movement Mechanics

Movement in Aurora C# operates on a Newtonian-inspired but simplified model. Ships travel in straight lines between destinations at speeds determined by their engine power and mass. Understanding how movement is calculated, how speed relates to fuel consumption, and how the time increment system interacts with travel is fundamental to effective fleet management.

## 10.1.1 Speed and Distance

**Speed Calculation:** A ship's maximum speed is determined by a straightforward formula (see [Section 8.3 Engines](../8-ship-design/8.3-engines.md) for engine design details):

```
Speed (km/s) = Total Engine Power / Ship Mass (tons)
```

Where:

- **Total Engine Power** is the sum of all engine components on the ship, measured in Engine Power (EP)
- **Ship Mass** is the total tonnage of the ship including hull, components, fuel, cargo, ammunition, and any other loaded weight

**Distance and Time:** Aurora C# measures distances in kilometers within a star system. Interstellar distances between systems are not directly traversed -- ships use jump points (see Section 10.2). Within a system, distances can range from thousands of kilometers (close orbit) to billions of kilometers (outer system bodies).

**Movement Per Increment:** The game processes movement in time increments selected by the player (5 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 20 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 8 hours, 1 day, 5 days, 30 days). During each increment, a ship moves:

```
Distance = Speed (km/s) x Time Increment (seconds)
```

For example, a ship traveling at 4,000 km/s over a 5-day increment would cover:
```
4,000 x 5 x 86,400 = 1,728,000,000 km (1.728 billion km)
```

**Sub-Pulse Resolution:** Aurora C# uses a 5-second sub-pulse as its smallest resolution. Even when you advance time by 30 days, the engine internally calculates in 5-second increments. This means ships can detect contacts, change course, and engage in combat during any 5-second window within a larger time advance. If an event occurs mid-increment (e.g., entering sensor range of a hostile), the game will interrupt the time advance and notify you.

**Fuel Consumption:** Fuel usage is directly proportional to speed and distance:

```
Fuel Used = Fuel Consumption Rate x Distance Traveled
```

The fuel consumption rate is determined by the engine type and efficiency (see [Section 14.1 Fuel](../14-logistics/14.1-fuel.md) for detailed fuel mechanics). More fuel-efficient engines (higher technology levels) consume less fuel per kilometer. Ships traveling at less than maximum speed (e.g., matching a slower group member) consume proportionally less fuel.

**Maximum Range:** A ship's maximum range is determined by its fuel capacity and consumption rate:

```
Max Range = Fuel Capacity / Fuel Consumption Rate per km
```

The Ship Designer displays estimated range for each design, which is useful for planning operations.

> **Tip:** Always check your task group's estimated range before sending it on a long-distance mission. Running out of fuel in deep space means the group is stranded until a tanker arrives -- or permanently if you have no tanker capability.

> **Tip:** Heavier ships are slower. A fully-loaded freighter is significantly slower than an empty one. Plan return trips with this in mind -- your freighter might take twice as long on the loaded leg of a cargo run.

## 10.1.2 Acceleration

Aurora C# uses an **instantaneous acceleration** model. Ships do not gradually accelerate to their maximum speed -- they are always assumed to be traveling at their calculated maximum speed (or the task group's maximum speed, if lower). When a ship changes course, it immediately moves in the new direction at full speed.

**Practical Implications:**

- There is no momentum or drift. Ships stop instantly when they reach their destination.
- Course changes are immediate with no turning radius.
- Ships can reverse direction with no time penalty.
- Combat maneuvering is effectively about positioning, not momentum management.

**Speed Changes:** A ship's speed can change during play due to:

- **Fuel depletion:** As fuel is consumed, mass decreases slightly, marginally increasing speed (negligible for most purposes)
- **Cargo loading/unloading:** Loading cargo increases mass and reduces speed; unloading does the opposite
- **Engine damage:** Combat damage to engines directly reduces engine power and thus speed
- **Component destruction:** Loss of any component reduces mass but loss of engines has a far greater impact on speed

**Throttle Settings:** Task groups can be set to travel at less than maximum speed. This is useful for:

- Conserving fuel on long transits
- Matching speed with a convoy you are escorting but not formally joined to
- Reducing thermal signature (engines at lower power produce less heat for thermal sensors to detect) (see [Section 11.1 Thermal/EM Signatures](../11-sensors-and-detection/11.1-thermal-em-signatures.md))

**Use Maximum Speed:** Fleets have a "Use Maximum Speed" checkbox on the Naval Organization window (see [Section 9.4 Fleet Organization](../9-fleet-management/9.4-fleet-organization.md)). When enabled, the system automatically rechecks fleet velocity at the start of each movement sub-pulse and applies the maximum available speed. This is particularly useful for fleets whose composition or condition changes during transit -- for example, if a slow ship is detached or a damaged engine comes back online, the fleet immediately accelerates to its new maximum without requiring manual order updates.

**Refuelling and Movement:** In Aurora C#, refuelling is not instantaneous and directly impacts fleet movement operations. Ships can only refuel at specific locations (spaceports, refuelling stations, refuelling hubs on ships, or vessels with refuelling systems). The "Underway Replenishment" technology allows refuelling while both vessels are moving together, starting at 20% of the normal rate and advancing to 100% through technology progression. Without this technology, ships must be stationary to transfer fuel, meaning fleets must stop for refuelling operations. Tankers assigned "Refuel Fleet" status will continuously top up fuel tanks during normal operations, keeping the fleet fueled without dedicated refuelling stops (assuming Underway Replenishment technology has been researched). See Section 9.5.3 for complete refuelling mechanics.

> **Tip:** In combat, speed is life. A faster ship can dictate engagement range -- it can close when advantageous and disengage when not. Always design combat ships with enough engine power to outrun expected threats, or at least match them.

> **Tip:** The instantaneous acceleration model means there is no advantage to "building up speed" before a maneuver. A ship at rest can immediately flee at full speed. This affects tactical planning -- you cannot trap a faster enemy by catching them stationary.

> **Tip:** Enable "Use Maximum Speed" on combat fleets that may detach damaged ships during an engagement. This ensures the remaining ships immediately benefit from the increased fleet speed rather than continuing at the old, slower rate.

## 10.1.3 Orbits

Aurora C# treats orbital mechanics in a simplified fashion. Bodies orbit their parent stars in circular or elliptical orbits, and their positions change over time. Ships, however, do not orbit in the traditional sense -- they can hold position relative to a body or at arbitrary coordinates.

**Planetary Orbits:** Planets, moons, asteroids, and comets all move along their orbital paths as game time advances. This means:

- The distance between two planets changes over time as they move in their orbits
- A destination that is close now may be far away in six months
- Jump points (if orbiting a star) may also move over time in some configurations

**Ship "Orbits":** When a task group is ordered to orbit a body, it maintains position relative to that body. As the body moves in its orbit, the task group moves with it. This is not a true Keplerian orbit -- the ships are simply attached to the body's reference frame.

**Stationary Positions:** Ships can also hold at fixed coordinates in space. If ordered to move to a specific point and stop, the task group remains at those absolute coordinates even as planets and other bodies move away from them.

**Implications for Navigation:**

- Plan transits based on current planetary positions, but be aware that long transits may arrive at a destination that has moved
- The game automatically updates movement orders to track a moving body -- if you order a task group to move to Mars, it will intercept Mars at its future position, not fly to where Mars was when the order was issued
- Short-range movements within a system are barely affected by orbital motion
- Long-range movements (outer system) can be significantly affected by orbital positions

**Lagrange Points:** Aurora C# includes Lagrange Points as navigational shortcuts for inter-body transit. Lagrange Points can reduce travel time between orbiting bodies, and fleet behavior regarding Lagrange Points is configurable via three radio button options (v2.8.0):

- **Manual LP:** Fleet ignores Lagrange Points unless a route is manually plotted through them
- **Plotted LP:** Fleet checks available Lagrange Points at order creation time and uses them if beneficial
- **Dynamic LP (v2.8.0):** Fleet rechecks its destination for optimal Lagrange Point routing during order execution — specifically when the fleet has no pending orders or completes sub-pulses. This enables real-time optimization as orbital positions change

Dynamic LP is the most fuel-efficient option for long patrols and standing orders, as the fleet continuously evaluates whether Lagrange Points offer a shorter path as bodies orbit.

> **Tip:** When planning operations in a system, check the System Map to see current body positions. A mining colony on a far-side asteroid might be a 2-day transit now but only 6 hours in three months when it passes closer. Timing operations around favorable orbital alignments can save significant fuel.

> **Tip:** Jump points have fixed positions in most game configurations. This makes them natural defensive chokepoints since their location is always known and predictable.
