# 10.2 Jump Transit

Interstellar travel in Aurora C# is accomplished through jump points -- naturally occurring connections between star systems. Ships cannot travel between stars directly; they must locate and transit through these points. The mechanics of jump transit significantly influence fleet composition, strategic planning, and defensive doctrine.

## 10.2.1 Jump Drive Requirements

To transit a jump point without a jump gate, a ship must either carry its own jump drive or be part of a squadron transit led by a jump-capable vessel.

**Jump Drive Basics:**
- Jump drives are ship components designed in the Component Design window
- Each jump drive has a maximum ship tonnage it can transit (the drive's "jump rating")
- The jump drive must be rated for at least the mass of the ship carrying it
- Jump drives add mass and cost to a ship design, creating a significant design trade-off

**Jump Drive Sizing:** A jump drive's capacity is determined by its technology level and size. Higher-technology jump drives are more mass-efficient, meaning a smaller drive can transit a larger ship. The formula is:

```
Jump Rating = Drive Size x Technology Multiplier
```

When designing a ship with a jump drive, the designer will indicate whether the installed drive can handle the ship's total mass. If the drive is undersized, the ship cannot self-transit through a jump point.

**Military vs Commercial Jump Drives:**
- **Military Jump Drives** are smaller and lighter for a given rating but more expensive
- **Commercial Jump Drives** are larger and heavier but cheaper and have better squadron transit capabilities
- Military drives have a shorter maximum squadron transit range
- Commercial drives are preferred for support ships that will be escorting fleets through jump points

**Design Trade-offs:**
- Installing a jump drive on every ship ensures independence but adds mass (reducing speed and other capabilities)
- Having only a few jump-capable ships saves mass on the majority of your fleet but creates a vulnerability if the jump ships are destroyed
- A balanced approach uses dedicated jump-capable escorts or tenders

> **Tip:** For small early-game fleets, putting a jump drive on every warship ensures maximum flexibility. As your fleet grows, consider dedicated jump escorts -- one jump-capable ship leading a squadron of non-jump warships through each transit.

> **Tip:** Always have redundant jump capability in any task force operating far from home. If your only jump-capable ship is destroyed, the rest of the fleet is stranded.

## 10.2.2 Squadron Transit

Squadron transit allows a single jump-capable ship to bring multiple non-jump-capable ships through a jump point simultaneously. This is the primary mechanism for moving large fleets without requiring every ship to carry its own jump drive.

**How Squadron Transit Works:**
1. A jump-capable ship (the "jump ship") initiates a squadron transit
2. All ships within the jump ship's squadron transit radius are carried through the jump point
3. The jump ship's squadron transit rating determines the maximum total tonnage it can transit (including itself)

**Squadron Transit Rating:** Each jump drive has a squadron transit rating in addition to its self-transit rating:

```
Squadron Capacity = Jump Rating x Squadron Transit Multiplier
```

The squadron transit multiplier is determined by the drive type:
- Military jump drives typically have a 2-3x multiplier (can transit 2-3x their base rating total)
- Commercial jump drives typically have a larger multiplier (can transit more total tonnage)

**Multiple Jump Ships:** If a fleet's total tonnage exceeds one jump ship's squadron transit capacity, you can use multiple jump ships. Each jump ship transits its portion of the fleet. The game handles the allocation automatically -- ships are distributed among available jump ships.

**Requirements for Squadron Transit:**
- All ships must be in the same task group (or at the same location, depending on the order used)
- The jump ship(s) must have sufficient combined squadron transit rating for the total fleet tonnage
- All ships must be at the jump point when transit is initiated
- The squadron transit happens instantaneously (no partial transits)

**Failed Transits:** If the jump ship's capacity is insufficient for the entire group, the transit will not occur. You must either reduce the group's tonnage (detach ships) or add more jump-capable vessels.

> **Tip:** When building fleet tenders (dedicated jump ships for squadron transit), size their drives for your expected fleet composition plus growth margin. A tender that can barely handle your current fleet will be obsolete the moment you add another cruiser.

> **Tip:** Commercial-engine jump tenders make excellent jump platforms for large fleets. They are slow but cheap, and their larger squadron transit multiplier means fewer tenders per fleet. Pair them with military escorts for protection.

## 10.2.3 Jump Gates

Jump gates are permanent structures built at jump points that allow any ship to transit without a jump drive. They are the preferred method for established transit routes, especially for commercial traffic.

**Construction:**
- Jump gates are built by construction ships (ships equipped with jump gate construction modules)
- The construction ship must be at the jump point to begin construction
- Building a gate takes time proportional to the gate's size (determined by game settings)
- Gates must be built on both sides of a jump point for two-way traffic (a gate on only one side allows transit only from that side)

**Gate Properties:**
- Jump gates allow unlimited transits per increment -- there is no capacity limit
- Any ship can use a gate regardless of size or whether it has a jump drive
- Gates are permanent once built (they can be destroyed by enemy action but do not degrade)
- Gates are visible to anyone who surveys the jump point

**Strategic Implications:**
- Gates eliminate the need for jump drives on routes where they are built, allowing more combat-optimized ship designs
- Gates reveal the locations of your jump points to anyone transiting from the other side
- Building a gate into unexplored space is a risk -- it enables easy access from the other side as well
- Defensive doctrine often involves NOT gating certain approaches, forcing enemies to use jump drives (which limits their fleet composition)

**Gate Construction Ships:** Purpose-built vessels with jump gate construction modules. These are typically:
- Large, slow commercial vessels
- Equipped with their own jump drive (to reach the far side of a jump point to gate it)
- Sometimes paired with escorts in hostile space

> **Tip:** Gate your core systems and established colonies early. The economic benefit of allowing commercial ships to transit without jump drives far outweighs the gate construction cost. Every freighter that doesn't need a jump drive has more cargo capacity.

> **Tip:** Think carefully before gating frontier jump points, especially those leading toward known or suspected hostile territory. An ungated approach forces attackers to bring jump-capable ships, limiting their force composition. A gated approach allows anything to pour through.

> **Tip:** Always gate both sides of a commercial route. A one-sided gate means ships can only transit in one direction without a drive, which is useful for some military applications but terrible for trade routes.

## 10.2.4 Transit Effects

Jumping through a jump point is not seamless. The transit process imposes temporary penalties on ships, creating a period of vulnerability immediately after arrival in a new system.

**Transit Disruption:** After transiting a jump point, ships experience a brief period of systems disruption:
- Sensors are temporarily blinded -- the ship cannot detect contacts for a short period after transit
- Weapons may be temporarily offline
- The disruption duration varies by game settings but is typically 30 seconds to a few minutes

**Tactical Implications:**
- A defending fleet positioned at a jump point can fire on transiting ships during their disruption period
- Transiting into a defended system is extremely dangerous -- your ships are blind and unable to fight back initially
- This makes jump point defense a powerful strategy and frontal assault through a defended jump point very costly

**Transit Signature:** Jump transits produce a detectable signature:
- Ships transiting a jump point create an energy pulse detectable by sensors at significant range
- This means a defending force is usually aware that something has transited, even if they cannot immediately identify what
- The signature reveals the jump point location to anyone who detects it

**Jump Point Assault Doctrine:** Given the disadvantages of jumping into a defended system:
- Scout with expendable ships first to assess defenses
- Use missile bombardment through the jump point (missiles can transit independently in some configurations)
- Time transits to arrive in overwhelming numbers before the disruption period ends
- Consider alternative approaches (other jump points into the same system) to avoid the strongest defenses

**Jump Sickness (optional rule):** In some game configurations, crews may experience degraded performance after transit, with the effect scaling based on the number of recent transits. This encourages minimizing unnecessary jump activity.

> **Tip:** Never jump a combat fleet into a system without scouting first. A single fast scout jumping through and immediately reporting (once its sensors recover) can tell you whether you face a minefield, a battle fleet, or empty space.

> **Tip:** When defending a jump point, position your forces at maximum weapons range from the point. This gives you time to fire on transiting enemies during their disruption period while remaining outside their potential weapons range when they recover.

> **Tip:** Stagger squadron transits of large fleets. Sending everything through at once means your entire force is disrupted simultaneously. Sending ships in waves means early arrivals can provide sensor coverage and fire support for later arrivals.
