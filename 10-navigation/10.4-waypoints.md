# 10.4 Waypoints

Waypoints are player-defined locations in space that serve as navigation markers, patrol anchors, and strategic reference points. While celestial bodies and jump points provide natural navigation landmarks, waypoints let you define arbitrary positions for tactical and logistical purposes. They are a simple but powerful tool for organizing fleet operations across complex star systems.

## 10.4.1 Creating Waypoints

**How to Create Waypoints:**
1. Open the System Map for the desired star system
2. Right-click (or use the waypoint tool) at the desired location in space
3. Select "Create Waypoint" from the context menu
4. Assign a name to the waypoint
5. The waypoint appears as a marker on the system map and becomes available as an order destination

**Waypoint Properties:**
- Waypoints are fixed points in space -- they do not move with orbiting bodies
- They have no physical presence (no mass, no signature, no collision)
- They are visible only to your empire (not detectable by other factions)
- They persist until manually deleted
- They can be renamed or relocated at any time

**Waypoint Placement Methods:**
- **Map Click:** Place at any arbitrary point on the system map
- **Coordinates:** Enter specific X/Y coordinates for precise placement
- **Relative to Body:** Place at a specified distance and bearing from a planet or other body (note: the waypoint remains fixed even as the body moves)

**Organizing Waypoints:** As you create many waypoints across multiple systems, organization becomes important:
- Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., "Sol JP-Alpha Centauri Patrol Point 1")
- Include the system name or abbreviation for quick reference
- Group related waypoints with sequential numbering
- Delete obsolete waypoints to reduce clutter

> **Tip:** Create waypoints at frequently-used fleet rally points, even if they coincide with a planet's current position. A waypoint named "Home Fleet Rally" is easier to find in an order dropdown than scrolling through 40 system bodies to find Earth.

> **Tip:** When a task group has a movement order to a waypoint, it will proceed directly there. Unlike orders to orbit a body, waypoint orders bring the group to the exact coordinates and stop.

## 10.4.2 Patrol Routes

Patrol routes use waypoints to define repeating movement patterns for task groups. This is one of the most common uses of waypoints and is essential for maintaining persistent surveillance of critical areas.

**Setting Up a Basic Patrol:**
1. Create two or more waypoints defining the patrol path
2. Select the task group that will patrol
3. In the Task Group orders, set the following sequence:
   - Move to Waypoint A
   - Move to Waypoint B
   - Move to Waypoint C (if applicable)
   - Set the order list to "Repeat" or "Cycle"
4. The task group will continuously loop through the waypoints

**Patrol Pattern Types:**

*Linear Patrol:*
- Two waypoints with the group moving back and forth between them
- Best for monitoring a narrow corridor (e.g., between a jump point and a colony)
- Simple to set up, covers a defined lane

*Triangle Patrol:*
- Three waypoints forming a triangle, often around a defended area
- Provides broader coverage than linear
- Good for monitoring approaches to a colony from multiple directions

*Box/Perimeter Patrol:*
- Four or more waypoints forming a perimeter around an area
- Maximum coverage of a defined zone
- Commonly used around a colony or critical installation

*Picket Line:*
- Multiple task groups, each patrolling a segment of a line
- Used to create a detection barrier across a likely approach route
- Each group covers its segment, reporting contacts to the main force

**Patrol Depth:** Consider the sensor range of your patrol ships when spacing waypoints. The patrol should ensure continuous sensor coverage along the route -- gaps between waypoints wider than twice your sensor range create blind spots.

**Patrol Speed and Endurance:** Patrol groups continuously burn fuel while moving. Calculate patrol endurance before assigning the route:
- Faster patrol speeds consume fuel more quickly but cover the route more frequently
- Slower speeds are more fuel-efficient but may leave gaps in coverage between passes
- Set conditional orders to return for refueling before the tanks run dry

> **Tip:** Place patrol waypoints so that sensor coverage overlaps along the route. If your ships have a 100M km sensor range, space waypoints no more than 150-180M km apart (accounting for the path the ship travels between them).

> **Tip:** For jump point monitoring, a simple two-point patrol perpendicular to the expected threat axis works well. Place waypoints about 50-100M km from the jump point on either side, giving your picket time to detect and report incoming threats before they close.

> **Tip:** Combine patrol orders with conditional combat orders. A patrol group that detects a hostile should have standing instructions on whether to engage, shadow, or retreat and report.

## 10.4.3 Strategic Use

Beyond simple patrol routes, waypoints serve numerous strategic purposes in fleet operations.

**Rally Points:** Waypoints make excellent fleet assembly points:
- Designate a waypoint away from any colony or body as the fleet rally
- Reinforcements can be ordered to the rally point from multiple origins
- The fleet concentrates at the waypoint before proceeding to the objective
- Rally points away from colonies keep your fleet assembly hidden from enemy scouts near your worlds

**Defensive Positions:** Strategic waypoint placement supports layered defense:
- **Outer Picket Line:** Waypoints at maximum sensor range from the defended area for early warning
- **Intercept Points:** Waypoints positioned between likely threat axes and the defended colony, where your fleet can cut off approaching enemies
- **Fall-Back Positions:** Pre-designated retreat waypoints where a damaged fleet can reform
- **Jump Point Control:** Waypoints at optimal weapons range from jump points for ambush positions

**Transit Corridors:** Waypoints can mark safe routes through dangerous space:
- Plot a path around known minefields using waypoints
- Mark routes that avoid detection range of known hostile positions
- Define standard transit lanes for commercial traffic
- Create channel markers for navigating complex asteroid fields

**Engagement Geometry:** In combat, waypoints help you set up favorable engagements:
- Place a waypoint at your desired engagement range from an expected contact
- Order your fleet to hold at the waypoint, forcing the enemy to close the distance
- Use waypoints to define flanking positions for pincer attacks
- Set retreat waypoints so your fleet knows exactly where to fall back to

**Logistics Coordination:**
- Mark fuel depot positions in deep space (where tankers wait to refuel passing groups)
- Define cargo transfer points where freighters meet for trans-shipment
- Mark emergency rally points for stranded or damaged ships

**Survey Coordination:** Waypoints can complement survey operations:
- Mark the extent of surveyed space in a system
- Note locations of potential interest discovered during surveys
- Define search sectors for gravitational surveys in large systems

**Waypoint Maintenance:** As your empire grows, waypoint management becomes a concern:
- Regularly review and delete obsolete waypoints (old patrol routes for abandoned sectors)
- Update waypoint names when their purpose changes
- Consider a naming convention that includes creation date or purpose code

> **Tip:** Establish a "defensive constellation" of waypoints around each colony: an inner ring at point-defense range, a middle ring at engagement range, and an outer ring at detection range. This gives you pre-defined positions for layered defense without scrambling to place ships under pressure.

> **Tip:** When planning an offensive, create waypoints for each phase of the operation: assembly point, transit waypoints around flanks, engagement positions, and withdrawal routes. Having these pre-planned means you can execute complex maneuvers quickly by simply ordering groups to sequential waypoints.

> **Tip:** Keep a waypoint at each jump point you have surveyed, named for the destination system. This serves as both a navigation aid and a quick reminder of your system's connectivity when issuing orders.
