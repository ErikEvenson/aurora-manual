# 12.4 Point Defense

Point defense is the art of destroying incoming missiles and hostile small craft before they can damage your ships. Aurora provides two primary point defense mechanisms: Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWS) using beam weapons, and Anti-Missile Missiles (AMMs) using dedicated interceptor missiles. Effective defense requires layering both systems and understanding their individual strengths.

## 12.4.1 CIWS

Close-In Weapon Systems are beam weapons configured for point defense duty. They automatically engage incoming missiles and hostile fighters within their fire control's designated range.

**Gauss Cannons -- The Premier PD Weapon**

Gauss cannons are the most commonly used CIWS weapon in Aurora. They fire bursts of kinetic projectiles at extreme rates, providing many individual hit opportunities against each incoming missile.

Key characteristics:
- **Rate of fire:** Fires multiple shots per 5-second combat tick (determined by the number of barrels and technology)
- **Damage per shot:** 1 point (sufficient to destroy any missile in one hit)
- **Range:** Short (10,000 km base, cannot be extended)
- **Tracking speed:** Uses the assigned fire control's tracking speed
- **Ammunition:** Uses gauss cannon ammunition (mass-produced, cheap)
- **Size:** Available from 1 to 3 turrets per installation, with each turret adding shots per burst

Gauss cannon configurations:

| Type | Shots per Burst | Size (HS) |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| Single Turret | Base shots | 1 |
| Twin Turret | 2x base shots | 2 |
| Triple Turret | 3x base shots | 3 |

The number of base shots is determined by the Gauss Cannon Rate of Fire technology, which can provide up to 6 shots per turret per burst.

**Lasers as PD Weapons**

Lasers can also serve as point defense weapons when assigned to a fire control in PD mode. Compared to gauss cannons:

- **Longer range:** Can engage at full fire control range (area defense mode)
- **No ammunition:** Uses capacitor recharge only
- **Fewer shots per tick:** Typically 1 shot per 5-second cycle (with recharge tech, potentially more)
- **Higher per-shot damage:** Can damage missiles at range brackets where gauss cannons cannot fire
- **Better for area defense:** Thinning salvos at distance before they reach gauss envelope

**Other PD-Capable Weapons**

- **Railguns:** Can serve as PD but lack the rate of fire of gauss cannons
- **Plasma Carronades:** Too short-ranged for effective PD in most cases
- **Mesons:** Cannot be used for PD (they pass through missiles without effect)

**CIWS Effectiveness Formula**

The number of missiles destroyed per combat tick by a CIWS installation:

```
Expected Kills = Shots per Tick * Hit Probability
Hit Probability = min(1.0, FC Tracking Speed / Missile Speed) * Crew Training
```

A single triple-turret gauss cannon with rate-of-fire 4 technology fires 12 shots per burst. Against missiles at 80% tracking (FC tracks faster than missile), expected kills per tick = 12 * 0.8 = 9.6, meaning roughly 9-10 missiles destroyed per 5-second combat cycle.

**CIWS Limitations**

- Gauss cannons have very short range (10,000 km) -- missiles are extremely close when engaged
- A single combat tick at final fire gives one chance per weapon to kill each missile
- If the salvo is larger than your CIWS can handle in one tick, excess missiles hit
- Ammunition consumption can be significant in prolonged engagements
- CIWS weapons used for PD cannot simultaneously fire offensively

## 12.4.2 PD Fire Controls

The fire control configuration determines when, how, and at what range your point defense weapons engage. Proper fire control setup is as important as the weapons themselves.

**Dedicated PD Fire Controls**

Best practice is to design fire controls specifically for point defense:

- **Maximum tracking speed:** The highest Fire Control Speed Rating technology available
- **Range consideration:** For final-fire gauss cannons, range beyond 10,000 km is unnecessary. For area-defense lasers, maximum range is desirable.
- **Size:** Standard 1 HS for ship-mounted PD. Reduced-size (0.5 HS) for fighters/FACs.

**Fire Control Mode Configuration**

| Mode | Use Case | Behavior |
|------|----------|----------|
| Final Fire | Last-ditch defense | Fires only at 10,000 km or less |
| Area Defense | Extended engagement | Fires at all missiles within FC range |
| Open Fire (Manual PD) | Hybrid offensive/defensive | Fires at designated targets including missiles |

**Multiple PD Fire Controls**

Each fire control can command a group of weapons. For comprehensive PD:

- Assign gauss cannons to one FC set to Final Fire
- Assign PD lasers to another FC set to Area Defense
- This provides two engagement layers from a single ship

You can also assign multiple weapons to a single PD fire control. All weapons on that FC fire at the same missile target each tick, which concentrates fire but may waste shots if the first hit destroys the target.

**Tracking Speed vs. Missile Technology**

As missile technology advances, missiles get faster. Your PD fire control tracking speed must keep pace:

| Era | Typical Missile Speed | Required FC Tracking |
|-----|----------------------|---------------------|
| Early game | 10,000-15,000 km/s | 12,000-20,000 km/s |
| Mid game | 20,000-30,000 km/s | 25,000-40,000 km/s |
| Late game | 40,000-60,000+ km/s | 50,000-80,000+ km/s |

If your tracking speed falls behind missile technology, CIWS becomes ineffective. This is why tracking speed research should be prioritized alongside offensive weapon research.

**PD Fire Control for AMMs**

AMM guidance requires missile fire controls (active sensors) with resolution 1. See Section 12.3.3 for details on AMM fire control configuration. Note that AMM fire controls are separate from beam PD fire controls -- you need both types for a layered defense.

**Practical Tips**

- Always design PD fire controls with the latest tracking speed technology
- Final-fire mode is most weight-efficient for gauss cannons (no need for long-range FC)
- Area-defense mode is most efficient for lasers (leverages their range advantage)
- Consider one backup PD fire control per ship in case the primary is destroyed
- PD fire controls do not need to be toggled manually -- they engage automatically when missiles threaten

## 12.4.3 Layered Defense

The most effective missile defense combines multiple engagement zones and weapon types, creating a layered defense that attrites incoming salvos progressively. No single PD system is sufficient against a determined missile attack.

**Defense Layers**

A comprehensive layered defense operates in three distinct zones:

**Layer 1: AMM Engagement Zone (500,000+ km to 50,000 km)**

- Anti-Missile Missiles intercept incoming missiles at long range
- Provides multiple engagement opportunities as missiles close
- AMMs must be faster than incoming missiles to catch them
- Requires resolution-1 missile fire controls (active sensors)
- Largest potential kill zone but each AMM engages only one target

**Layer 2: Area Beam Defense (50,000 km to 10,000 km)**

- Lasers and other long-range beam weapons in area-defense mode
- Fires each combat tick as missiles transit through this zone
- Multiple engagement opportunities (depending on missile speed and weapon recharge)
- No ammunition concern (capacitor-based)
- Limited by rate of fire and tracking speed

**Layer 3: Final Fire CIWS (10,000 km)**

- Gauss cannons and short-range weapons in final-fire mode
- Maximum number of shots in a single burst
- Last chance to destroy missiles before impact
- Highest hit probability (close range = best tracking geometry)
- One engagement opportunity only

**Layer Synergy**

The layers work together mathematically. If each layer kills a percentage of incoming missiles:

```
Missiles Surviving = Incoming * (1 - Layer1_Kill%) * (1 - Layer2_Kill%) * (1 - Layer3_Kill%)
```

Example against 100 incoming missiles:
- Layer 1 (AMMs) kills 40%: 60 missiles survive
- Layer 2 (Area PD) kills 30%: 42 missiles survive
- Layer 3 (CIWS) kills 50%: 21 missiles survive and hit

Without layered defense using only CIWS: 50 missiles hit. The difference is enormous.

**Fleet Defensive Formation**

Dedicated PD escorts can protect capital ships:

- **PD Frigates:** Small ships packed with gauss cannons and AMM launchers
- **Screen Position:** PD escorts operate in the same task group as high-value targets
- **Area defense weapons protect the entire task group, not just the firing ship**
- **Specialized roles:** Some escorts handle AMMs (layer 1), others handle CIWS (layer 3)

**Fleet PD Configuration Example**

For a battle group of 4 capital ships:
- 2 dedicated PD frigates with 6x triple gauss cannons each (area defense)
- Each capital ship with 2x twin gauss cannons (final fire)
- 1 AMM escort with 20x size-1 launchers and large AMM magazines
- Combined: AMMs thin salvos at distance, PD frigates clean up mid-range, capital ship gauss handles leakers

**Overcoming Layered Defense (Attacker's Perspective)**

Understanding defense helps design better offense:

- **Salvo size:** Larger salvos overwhelm each layer
- **Missile speed:** Faster missiles reduce time in each engagement zone
- **ECM:** Reduces fire control tracking, degrading PD hit probability
- **Decoys:** Waste PD shots on false targets (if the game supports them)
- **Multiple vectors:** Salvos arriving from different directions split PD coverage
- **Mixed salvos:** Fast cheap missiles to absorb PD, followed by slow heavy missiles with big warheads

**Common PD Mistakes**

- Building only one layer of defense (typically only CIWS) and being overwhelmed
- Neglecting ammunition: gauss cannons run out of ammo in sustained engagements
- Tracking speed too low: PD weapons cannot hit advanced missiles
- Not enough PD fire controls: weapons without FCs cannot engage
- All PD on one ship: if that ship is destroyed, the entire fleet loses PD
- Ignoring AMMs: they provide the largest engagement zone and highest total kill potential
- Not matching AMM speed to expected threat missile speed

**Scaling PD with Threat Level**

Plan PD capacity based on expected enemy missile doctrine:

- Against NPR (Non-Player Races): Start with moderate PD, scale up after observing their salvos
- Against known missile powers: Match PD capacity to 1.5-2x the expected salvo size
- In unknown territories: Over-invest in PD until the threat level is understood
- Always carry surplus AMMs and gauss ammunition for extended engagements
