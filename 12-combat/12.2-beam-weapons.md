# 12.2 Beam Weapons

Beam weapons are direct-fire energy systems that hit their targets instantly at the speed of light. Unlike missiles, they require no ammunition (though some use capacitor-based recharge cycles) and cannot be intercepted by point defense. Their main limitations are range and accuracy against fast-moving targets. Aurora features several beam weapon types, each with distinct tactical roles.

## 12.2.1 Laser Types

Lasers are the most common and versatile beam weapon in Aurora. They come in several variants, each offering different trade-offs between size, range, damage, and rate of fire.

**Standard Lasers**

Standard lasers are the baseline beam weapon. They are available in sizes from 10 cm (0.25 HS) up to 50+ cm caliber. Key characteristics:

- Damage and range scale with caliber (size)
- Rate of fire: one shot every 5 seconds (base recharge time)
- Capacitor recharge technology can reduce this to as low as every 5 seconds per 3 shots
- Armor penetration: equal to the weapon's damage rating at point-blank range

| Caliber | Size (HS) | Base Damage | Max Range (base) |
|---------|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| 10 cm | 1 | 3 | 30,000 km |
| 12 cm | 1.5 | 4 | 60,000 km |
| 15 cm | 2.5 | 5 | 90,000 km |
| 20 cm | 3.5 | 8 | 120,000 km |
| 25 cm | 4.5 | 10 | 160,000 km |
| 30 cm | 6 | 12 | 200,000 km |
| 35 cm | 7 | 14 | 240,000 km |
| 40 cm | 8 | 16 | 280,000 km |
| 50 cm | 10 | 20 | 320,000 km |

Note: The above table shows approximate base values at starting technology. Exact size, damage, and range depend on Laser Focal Size, Laser Wavelength, and Capacitor Recharge Rate technologies researched. Higher wavelength tech increases range; higher capacitor tech increases size and power requirements. See Section 12.2.7 for ground-truth reference examples at specific tech levels (e.g., 10cm C3 UV = 3 HS, 120,000 km range; 20cm C5 UV = 6 HS, 400,000 km range).

**Reduced-Size Lasers**

Reduced-size lasers sacrifice range for a smaller hull footprint. They deal the same damage as standard lasers of the same caliber but have reduced maximum range. Available reduction options:

- **0.75x range, 0.75x size:** 25% smaller and shorter-ranged
- **0.50x range, 0.50x size:** Half the size, half the range

These are valuable for:
- Fighter/FAC armament (where hull space is at a premium)
- Close-range brawler ships
- Point defense installations where range beyond 10,000 km is less critical

**Spinal Mount Lasers**

Spinal mount lasers double the caliber beyond what would normally fit in a given hull size. A ship can mount one spinal weapon, which occupies a significant percentage of the hull. Characteristics:

- Roughly twice the size/caliber of the largest standard laser that would fit
- Massive damage per shot
- Same rate of fire as standard lasers
- Must be built into the ship design from the start (cannot be refitted)
- The ship can only fire the spinal mount at targets within its forward arc

Spinal lasers are devastating on large warships designed for decisive engagements. A single spinal mount can crack through heavy armor in one or two shots where standard weapons would require many volleys.

**Infrared and Ultraviolet Lasers**

Wavelength technology affects laser performance:

- **Infrared:** Longer wavelength, increased range but reduced damage per shot
- **Ultraviolet/X-Ray:** Shorter wavelength, reduced range but increased damage per shot
- **Visible/Standard:** Baseline balance of range and damage

The choice depends on engagement doctrine: stand-off ships benefit from infrared, while close-range combatants prefer ultraviolet.

## 12.2.2 Range and Damage

Beam weapon effectiveness diminishes with range. Understanding this falloff is essential for designing effective combat ships and choosing engagement distances.

**Damage Falloff with Range**

All beam weapons in Aurora lose damage over distance. The damage at a given range is calculated in discrete range brackets:

```
Damage at Range = Base Damage * (1 - Range / Max Range)
```

More specifically, damage is divided into range increments. A weapon with maximum range of 320,000 km has its damage spread across range brackets (typically in 10,000 km increments). At each bracket, the weapon does proportionally less damage:

| Range (% of max) | Damage (% of base) |
|------------------|---------------------|
| 0-10% | 100% |
| 10-20% | ~90% |
| 20-30% | ~80% |
| 30-40% | ~70% |
| 40-50% | ~60% |
| 50-60% | ~50% |
| 60-70% | ~40% |
| 70-80% | ~30% |
| 80-90% | ~20% |
| 90-100% | ~10% |

This means a weapon firing at maximum range does minimal damage -- typically just 1 point. Effective engagement range is generally considered to be 50-60% of maximum range, where you still deal meaningful damage.

**Range Bracket System**

Aurora divides weapon range into 4 brackets based on the weapon's maximum range:

- **Bracket 1 (0-25% of max range):** Full damage
- **Bracket 2 (25-50%):** 75% damage
- **Bracket 3 (50-75%):** 50% damage
- **Bracket 4 (75-100%):** 25% damage

Beyond maximum range, the weapon cannot fire at all.

**Implications for Ship Design**

- Long-range weapons are best for kiting tactics: maintain distance, chip away at the enemy
- Short-range weapons (plasma carronades, reduced-size lasers) deliver devastating alpha strikes but require closing to knife-fight range
- Consider the trade-off: a 50 cm laser at 50% range does 10 damage, while two 25 cm lasers at 50% range do 5+5=10 damage with more flexibility

**Range and Armor Penetration**

The damage value at a given range also determines armor penetration. A weapon dealing 8 damage at a particular range bracket has armor penetration of 8 -- it can penetrate up to 8 layers of armor. If the target has more armor layers than the weapon's damage, the shot is stopped without reaching internal components.

This creates an important interaction: at long range, your weapons deal less damage AND have lower armor penetration. A ship with heavy armor can effectively ignore long-range beam fire.

## 12.2.3 Tracking Speed

Tracking speed determines whether your beam weapons can reliably hit their targets. Fast-moving ships and missiles require high tracking speeds for consistent hits.

**Hit Probability Formula**

The full hit probability calculation for beam weapons is:

```
Hit Chance = (Tracking Speed / Target Speed) * Range Modifier * Crew Training * Commander Bonus * ECM/ECCM Modifier
```

Where:
- **Tracking Speed / Target Speed:** Base accuracy (capped at 1.0)
- **Range Modifier:** Generally 1.0 for beam weapons (range affects damage, not accuracy, in C# Aurora)
- **Crew Training:** Training grade from 0.1 (untrained) to 1.0 (fully trained), typically affecting overall combat effectiveness
- **Commander Bonus:** Tactical skill of the ship's commanding officer
- **ECM/ECCM Modifier:** Electronic warfare effects (see [Section 12.5 Electronic Warfare](12.5-electronic-warfare.md))

**Target Speed Calculation**

The "target speed" used in the tracking calculation is the target's current velocity relative to the firing ship. Key points:

- A target approaching directly at 10,000 km/s has a relative speed of 10,000 km/s
- A target at the same velocity on a parallel course has relative speed of 0 km/s
- Crossing targets (perpendicular movement) use their full speed value
- The worst case for tracking is a target crossing at high speed at close range (high angular velocity)

In practice, Aurora uses the target's absolute speed for this calculation in most cases, simplifying the geometry.

**Tracking Speed Requirements by Target Type**

| Target Type | Typical Speed | Required Tracking |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Freighters/Transports | 1,000-3,000 km/s | Low (any FC works) |
| Warships | 3,000-8,000 km/s | Medium |
| Fast Escorts | 5,000-12,000 km/s | Medium-High |
| FACs | 8,000-15,000 km/s | High |
| Fighters | 5,000-20,000 km/s | Very High |
| Missiles | 10,000-50,000+ km/s | Extreme |

**Tracking Time Bonus vs Missiles (C# Aurora):**

Energy weapons and beam fire controls gain a tracking speed bonus when engaging missiles that have been continuously tracked by active sensors. This represents the predictable trajectories of missiles making them easier to hit over time.

- Bonus: 1% tracking speed increase for every 5 seconds a missile remains continuously tracked by active sensors
- Maximum tracking time (and bonus) is determined by technology level
- The bonus applies only to tracking speed, not base-to-hit chance
- Provides no improvement if tracking speed already exceeds missile speed
- Applies exclusively to missiles (not ships) due to their predictable trajectories

**Technology Progression:**

| Technology | Max Tracking Time | Max Bonus | Research Cost |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|---------------|
| Starting | 30 seconds | 6% | 1,000 RP |
| Level 2 | 45 seconds | 9% | ~2,000 RP |
| Level 3 | 60 seconds | 12% | ~4,000 RP |
| Level 4 | 80 seconds | 16% | ~8,000 RP |
| Level 5 | 120 seconds | 24% | ~16,000 RP |
| Level 6 | 160 seconds | 32% | ~32,000 RP |
| Level 7 | 200 seconds | 40% | ~64,000 RP |
| Level 8 | 250 seconds | 50% | ~128,000 RP |
| Level 9 | 320 seconds | 64% | ~256,000 RP |
| Level 10 | 400 seconds | 80% | ~512,000 RP |

Technologies follow the naming format: "Max Tracking Time for Bonus vs Missiles: [X] Seconds ([Y]%)"

**Designing for Tracking**

- Anti-ship fire controls need moderate tracking (matching enemy warship speeds)
- Point defense fire controls need maximum tracking speed (matching missile speeds)
- The same beam weapon can be assigned to different fire controls for different roles
- Higher tracking speed technology does not increase fire control size -- always research it
- Tracking time bonus vs missiles provides significant point defense improvement at higher tech levels

**Crew Training Effect**

Poorly trained crews (see [Section 16.2 Skills and Bonuses](../16-commanders/16.2-skills-and-bonuses.md)) suffer accuracy penalties. A green crew at 50% training effectively halves the fire control's tracking capability. This makes crew training one of the most important "invisible" combat multipliers.

**Multiple Shots and Rate of Fire**

High rate of fire weapons (especially with capacitor recharge technology) get multiple chances to hit per combat tick. Even at low hit probability, throwing many dice improves the chance of at least one hit. This is why gauss cannons (which fire many projectiles per burst) are effective point defense despite their individually low accuracy against fast missiles.

### Fractional Capacitor Technology (v1.13+)

As of v1.13, researching each capacitor recharge level also grants interpolated fractional capacitor technologies. For each capacitor level researched (up to capacitor 4), the game unlocks three intermediate recharge rates at 0.25 increments (e.g., researching capacitor 2 grants 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75 recharge rates). Additional fractional levels at 4.5, 5.5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, and 15 become available at higher tech levels.

These fractional capacitor values allow finer tuning of beam weapon rate of fire, producing more efficient weapon designs with better cost-to-firepower ratios. Rather than committing to a full recharge rate upgrade, designers can select intermediate values that better match their power budget and tactical requirements.

## 12.2.4 Power Allocation and Recharge

In C# Aurora, the beam weapon recharge system has been fundamentally redesigned to handle damaged power plants more effectively.

**Power Allocation Priority System:**

When a ship's power plants are damaged and cannot supply full power to all weapons simultaneously, power is allocated weapon by weapon until the available power is exhausted. This means some weapons may not be recharged at all, but those that do receive power are recharged at the maximum rate.

The allocation order prioritizes weapons with the lowest power requirements first. Once a weapon is fully recharged and fires, it requires no additional power until its next recharge cycle, freeing power for other weapons.

This differs significantly from VB6 Aurora, where damaged power plants reduced recharge rates proportionally for all weapons simultaneously. The C# system ensures at least some weapons achieve maximum fire rate rather than all weapons being equally degraded.

**Strategic Implications:**

- Ships with mixed weapon sizes benefit: small weapons recharge first and keep firing
- A ship with one damaged reactor may still operate several weapons at full rate
- Large weapons with high power draws are the first to go offline when power is scarce
- Consider mixing weapon sizes to maintain some combat capability even when damaged

## 12.2.5 Weapon Failure

C# Aurora introduces a weapon failure mechanic that applies to all beam weapons and missile launchers:

**Core Mechanic:**

At the point when any weapon (energy-based or missile launcher) fires, there is a **1% chance the weapon will suffer a failure**.

**Failure Resolution:**

- **With maintenance supplies (MSP) available:** The weapon receives instant repair and fires normally. MSP is consumed for the repair.
- **Without maintenance supplies:** The weapon becomes damaged and cannot fire until repaired.

**Design Implications:**

- Maintenance supply management is strategically important during prolonged combat
- Ships with more weapons suffer more failures on average (more rolls per combat tick)
- Extended engagements drain MSP through weapon failures even without enemy fire
- Ships deploying far from resupply should carry generous MSP reserves
- For point defense, high fire concentration settings increase the chance of weapon failure on expensive systems

## 12.2.6 Specific Weapon Types

### Gauss Cannons

Gauss cannons are kinetic projectile weapons primarily used for point defense. They fire multiple shots per combat tick and deal 1 damage per projectile, making them ideal for destroying unarmored missiles. Gauss cannons do not require reactor power.

**Gauss Cannon Reference Example:**

| Stat | Gauss Cannon R3-100 |
|------|---------------------|
| Damage | 1 per shot |
| Rate of Fire | 3 shots/5 sec |
| Range | 30,000 km |
| Size | 6 HS |
| HTK | 2 |
| Power | None (no reactor required) |
| Cost | 36 |
| Crew | 24 |
| Materials | 36 Vendarite |
| Dev Cost | 360 RP |

**Research Category:** As of v2.0, gauss cannon technologies (including gauss turrets) are researched under the **Missiles and Kinetic Weapons** category rather than the Energy Weapons category. Additionally, 10cm railguns are available as a point defense option for NPR designs.

**Research Progression (C# Aurora):**

Rate of Fire technology determines the number of shots per turret per burst. The research costs were lowered in C# Aurora to make gauss cannons more accessible earlier in development:

| Rate of Fire | Research Cost |
|-------------|---------------|
| 2 shots | 1,500 RP |
| 3 shots | 5,000 RP |
| 4 shots | 15,000 RP |
| 5 shots | 45,000 RP |
| 6 shots | 135,000 RP |
| 8 shots | 450,000 RP |

Launch Velocity technology progression:

| Level | Research Cost |
|-------|---------------|
| Level 1 | 500 RP |
| Level 2 | 1,500 RP |
| Level 3 | 5,000 RP |
| Level 4 | 15,000 RP |
| Level 5 | 45,000 RP |
| Level 6 | 135,000 RP |

### Particle Beams

Particle beams are beam weapons that fire streams of charged particles. They occupy a middle ground between lasers and plasma carronades in terms of range and damage.

**Key Properties:**
- Size: 7 HS (350 tons) for standard particle beams
- Damage does not decrease with range (full damage within max range, like railguns)
- Cannot be used for point defense
- Damage is applied in a single column of armor, providing focused penetration

**Particle Beam Reference Example:**

| Stat | Particle Beam-4 |
|------|-----------------|
| Beam Strength | 4 |
| Rate of Fire | 10 sec |
| Range | 200,000 km |
| Size | 7 HS |
| HTK | 3 |
| Power | 10 (recharge 5/5 sec) |
| Cost | 70 |
| Crew | 70 |
| Materials | 14 Duranium, 14 Boronide, 42 Corundium |
| Dev Cost | 1,550 RP |

**Particle Lance (C# Aurora only):**

The Particle Lance is an advanced variant of the Particle Beam available only in C# Aurora. It requires both "Particle Beam Range 200,000 km" and "Particle Beam Strength 6" technologies to unlock.

| Attribute | Modifier vs Standard Particle Beam |
|---|---|
| Damage | 2x |
| Size | 2x |
| Hit Points | 2x |
| Crew Requirements | 2x |
| Power Requirement | 2.5x |
| Build Cost | 3x |
| Development Cost | 2x (base 30,000 RP) |

The Particle Lance maintains the constant-damage-at-range property of particle beams while concentrating all damage into a single armor column, making it the premiere armor-cracking weapon for heavily armored targets.

### Plasma Carronades (v2.2.0 Update)

Plasma carronades function identically to lasers with several important distinctions:

**Size and Design Parameters:**
- No reduced-size variants available
- Cannot be mounted in turrets
- Minimum focal tech: 15 cm
- Maximum focal tech: 100 cm (compared to 80 cm for lasers)
- Research cost of each carronade focal tech is half the cost of the equivalent laser focal tech
- Spinal-mount plasma carronades are now possible

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Same range modifier as infrared lasers (no wavelength tech variants)
- Damage gradient of 1 (matching missiles rather than typical beam weapons -- no damage falloff with range within max range)
- Cost is double that of equivalent infrared lasers
- Physical size is half that of comparable laser systems

**Plasma Carronade Reference Example:**

| Stat | 30cm C5 Plasma Carronade |
|------|--------------------------|
| Damage | 24 |
| Rate of Fire | 25 sec |
| Range | 240,000 km |
| Size | 9 HS |
| HTK | 4 |
| Power | 24 (recharge 5/5 sec) |
| Cost | 48 |
| Crew | 90 |
| Materials | 9.6 Duranium, 9.6 Boronide, 28.8 Corundium |
| Dev Cost | 2,300 RP |

**Strategic Implications:**
- The damage gradient of 1 means full damage at any range within the weapon's envelope, unlike lasers which lose damage at distance
- The half-size advantage makes them competitive for designs where tonnage is critical
- Higher cost but consistent damage delivery at all engagement ranges
- Particularly effective at maximum range where lasers would deal reduced damage

## 12.2.7 Beam Weapon Reference Tables

The following tables provide ground-truth specifications for representative beam weapons at various tech levels. These serve as design baselines and cost/performance benchmarks.

### Laser Examples

| Stat | 10cm C3 Ultraviolet Laser | 20cm C5 Ultraviolet Laser |
|------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Damage | 3 | 10 |
| Rate of Fire | 5 sec | 10 sec |
| Range | 120,000 km | 400,000 km |
| Size | 3 HS | 6 HS |
| HTK | 1 | 3 |
| Power | 3 (recharge 3/5 sec) | 10 (recharge 5/5 sec) |
| Cost | 20 | 63 |
| Crew | 30 | 60 |
| Materials | 4 Duranium, 4 Boronide, 12 Corundium | 12.6 Duranium, 12.6 Boronide, 37.8 Corundium |
| Dev Cost | 200 RP | 630 RP |

### Railgun Examples

| Stat | 10cm Railgun V4/C3 | 20cm Railgun V4/C4 |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Damage per Shot | 1 (4 shots) | 4 (4 shots) |
| Rate of Fire | 5 sec | 15 sec |
| Range | 40,000 km | 160,000 km |
| Size | 3 HS | 7 HS |
| HTK | 1 | 3 |
| Power | 3 (recharge 3/5 sec) | 12 (recharge 4/5 sec) |
| Cost | 20 | 55 |
| Crew | 30 | 70 |
| Materials | 4 Duranium, 4 Boronide, 12 Neutronium | 11 Duranium, 11 Boronide, 33 Neutronium |
| Dev Cost | 650 RP | 1,175 RP |

Note: Railgun damage does not decrease with range. Full damage at any distance within maximum range.

### Meson Cannon Examples

| Stat | R4.5/C3 Meson Cannon | R20/C5 Meson Cannon |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Damage | 1 (ignores shields/armor) | 1 (ignores shields/armor) |
| Rate of Fire | 5 sec | 10 sec |
| Range | 45,000 km | 200,000 km |
| Size | 3 HS | 6 HS |
| HTK | 1 | 3 |
| Power | 3 (recharge 3/5 sec) | 10 (recharge 5/5 sec) |
| Cost | 5 | 20 |
| Crew | 30 | 60 |
| Materials | 1 Duranium, 1 Boronide, 3 Corundium | 4 Duranium, 4 Boronide, 12 Corundium |
| Dev Cost | 900 RP | 3,100 RP |

Note: Meson damage is always 1 regardless of weapon size. The advantage is bypassing shields and armor entirely (subject to Meson Armor Retardation technology).

### High Power Microwave Example

| Stat | R20/C5 High Power Microwave |
|------|------------------------------|
| Damage | 1 (3 vs shields; electronic systems only after shields down) |
| Rate of Fire | 10 sec |
| Range | 200,000 km |
| Size | 6 HS |
| HTK | 3 |
| Power | 10 (recharge 5/5 sec) |
| Cost | 126 |
| Crew | 60 |
| Materials | 25.2 Duranium, 25.2 Boronide, 75.6 Corundium |
| Dev Cost | 3,100 RP |

Note: HPM does 3 damage vs shields. Once shields are down, it targets electronic systems only. It does not bypass armor -- it requires shields to be depleted first, then damages electronic components on the target.

## 12.2.8 Atmospheric Effects

**In C# Aurora, there is no penalty for energy weapons firing in or through an atmosphere.** This is a significant change from VB6 Aurora, which imposed restrictions on energy weapon effectiveness in atmospheric conditions.

This means:
- Energy weapons are viable tools for planetary bombardment without atmospheric degradation
- Orbital energy weapon fire is not reduced by planetary atmosphere
- Ground-based energy weapons fire at full effectiveness
- The only practical limitations on orbital bombardment are range and power, not atmosphere

See Section 12.6 for full planetary bombardment mechanics including casualty rates and environmental effects.

**Practical Tips**

- Never pair offensive weapons with PD-grade fire controls (or vice versa) unless you want a dual-purpose system
- Track the speed of your expected enemies and design fire controls to match
- Against very fast targets, multiple low-damage hits (gauss) are more reliable than single high-damage shots (lasers)
- Remember that target speed is the limiting factor: you cannot hit what you cannot track, no matter how powerful your weapons
- Commander selection matters: a skilled tactical officer provides noticeable accuracy bonuses
- Carry sufficient MSP for the 1% weapon failure rate over extended engagements
- When power is limited, smaller weapons maintain fire rate while large weapons go offline first
