# 12.2 Beam Weapons

Beam weapons are direct-fire energy systems that hit their targets instantly at the speed of light. Unlike missiles, they require no ammunition (though some use capacitor-based recharge cycles) and cannot be intercepted by point defense. Their main limitations are range and accuracy against fast-moving targets. Aurora features several beam weapon types, each with distinct tactical roles.

## 12.2.1 Laser Types

Lasers are the most common and versatile beam weapon in Aurora. They come in several variants, each offering different trade-offs between size, range, damage, and rate of fire.

**Standard Lasers**

Standard lasers are the baseline beam weapon. They are available in sizes from 10 cm (0.25 HS) up to 50+ cm caliber. Key characteristics:

- Damage and range scale with caliber (size)
- Rate of fire: one shot every 5 seconds (base recharge time)
- Capacitor recharge technology can reduce this to as low as every 5 seconds per 3 shots
- Armor penetration: equal to the weapon's damage rating at point-blank range

| Caliber | Size (HS) | Base Damage | Max Range (base) |
|---------|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| 10 cm | 1 | 3 | 30,000 km |
| 12 cm | 1.5 | 4 | 60,000 km |
| 15 cm | 2.5 | 5 | 90,000 km |
| 20 cm | 3.5 | 8 | 120,000 km |
| 25 cm | 4.5 | 10 | 160,000 km |
| 30 cm | 6 | 12 | 200,000 km |
| 35 cm | 7 | 14 | 240,000 km |
| 40 cm | 8 | 16 | 280,000 km |
| 50 cm | 10 | 20 | 320,000 km |

Note: Exact values depend on the Laser Focal Size and Laser Wavelength technologies researched. Higher tech levels increase both damage and range.

**Reduced-Size Lasers**

Reduced-size lasers sacrifice range for a smaller hull footprint. They deal the same damage as standard lasers of the same caliber but have reduced maximum range. Available reduction options:

- **0.75x range, 0.75x size:** 25% smaller and shorter-ranged
- **0.50x range, 0.50x size:** Half the size, half the range

These are valuable for:
- Fighter/FAC armament (where hull space is at a premium)
- Close-range brawler ships
- Point defense installations where range beyond 10,000 km is less critical

**Spinal Mount Lasers**

Spinal mount lasers double the caliber beyond what would normally fit in a given hull size. A ship can mount one spinal weapon, which occupies a significant percentage of the hull. Characteristics:

- Roughly twice the size/caliber of the largest standard laser that would fit
- Massive damage per shot
- Same rate of fire as standard lasers
- Must be built into the ship design from the start (cannot be refitted)
- The ship can only fire the spinal mount at targets within its forward arc

Spinal lasers are devastating on large warships designed for decisive engagements. A single spinal mount can crack through heavy armor in one or two shots where standard weapons would require many volleys.

**Infrared and Ultraviolet Lasers**

Wavelength technology affects laser performance:

- **Infrared:** Longer wavelength, increased range but reduced damage per shot
- **Ultraviolet/X-Ray:** Shorter wavelength, reduced range but increased damage per shot
- **Visible/Standard:** Baseline balance of range and damage

The choice depends on engagement doctrine: stand-off ships benefit from infrared, while close-range combatants prefer ultraviolet.

## 12.2.2 Range and Damage

Beam weapon effectiveness diminishes with range. Understanding this falloff is essential for designing effective combat ships and choosing engagement distances.

**Damage Falloff with Range**

All beam weapons in Aurora lose damage over distance. The damage at a given range is calculated in discrete range brackets:

```
Damage at Range = Base Damage * (1 - Range / Max Range)
```

More specifically, damage is divided into range increments. A weapon with maximum range of 320,000 km has its damage spread across range brackets (typically in 10,000 km increments). At each bracket, the weapon does proportionally less damage:

| Range (% of max) | Damage (% of base) |
|------------------|---------------------|
| 0-10% | 100% |
| 10-20% | ~90% |
| 20-30% | ~80% |
| 30-40% | ~70% |
| 40-50% | ~60% |
| 50-60% | ~50% |
| 60-70% | ~40% |
| 70-80% | ~30% |
| 80-90% | ~20% |
| 90-100% | ~10% |

This means a weapon firing at maximum range does minimal damage -- typically just 1 point. Effective engagement range is generally considered to be 50-60% of maximum range, where you still deal meaningful damage.

**Range Bracket System**

Aurora divides weapon range into 4 brackets based on the weapon's maximum range:

- **Bracket 1 (0-25% of max range):** Full damage
- **Bracket 2 (25-50%):** 75% damage
- **Bracket 3 (50-75%):** 50% damage
- **Bracket 4 (75-100%):** 25% damage

Beyond maximum range, the weapon cannot fire at all.

**Implications for Ship Design**

- Long-range weapons are best for kiting tactics: maintain distance, chip away at the enemy
- Short-range weapons (plasma carronades, reduced-size lasers) deliver devastating alpha strikes but require closing to knife-fight range
- Consider the trade-off: a 50 cm laser at 50% range does 10 damage, while two 25 cm lasers at 50% range do 5+5=10 damage with more flexibility

**Range and Armor Penetration**

The damage value at a given range also determines armor penetration. A weapon dealing 8 damage at a particular range bracket has armor penetration of 8 -- it can penetrate up to 8 layers of armor. If the target has more armor layers than the weapon's damage, the shot is stopped without reaching internal components.

This creates an important interaction: at long range, your weapons deal less damage AND have lower armor penetration. A ship with heavy armor can effectively ignore long-range beam fire.

## 12.2.3 Tracking Speed

Tracking speed determines whether your beam weapons can reliably hit their targets. Fast-moving ships and missiles require high tracking speeds for consistent hits.

**Hit Probability Formula**

The full hit probability calculation for beam weapons is:

```
Hit Chance = (Tracking Speed / Target Speed) * Range Modifier * Crew Training * Commander Bonus * ECM/ECCM Modifier
```

Where:
- **Tracking Speed / Target Speed:** Base accuracy (capped at 1.0)
- **Range Modifier:** Generally 1.0 for beam weapons (range affects damage, not accuracy, in C# Aurora)
- **Crew Training:** Training grade from 0.1 (untrained) to 1.0 (fully trained), typically affecting overall combat effectiveness
- **Commander Bonus:** Tactical skill of the ship's commanding officer
- **ECM/ECCM Modifier:** Electronic warfare effects (see Section 12.5)

**Target Speed Calculation**

The "target speed" used in the tracking calculation is the target's current velocity relative to the firing ship. Key points:

- A target approaching directly at 10,000 km/s has a relative speed of 10,000 km/s
- A target at the same velocity on a parallel course has relative speed of 0 km/s
- Crossing targets (perpendicular movement) use their full speed value
- The worst case for tracking is a target crossing at high speed at close range (high angular velocity)

In practice, Aurora uses the target's absolute speed for this calculation in most cases, simplifying the geometry.

**Tracking Speed Requirements by Target Type**

| Target Type | Typical Speed | Required Tracking |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Freighters/Transports | 1,000-3,000 km/s | Low (any FC works) |
| Warships | 3,000-8,000 km/s | Medium |
| Fast Escorts | 5,000-12,000 km/s | Medium-High |
| FACs | 8,000-15,000 km/s | High |
| Fighters | 5,000-20,000 km/s | Very High |
| Missiles | 10,000-50,000+ km/s | Extreme |

**Designing for Tracking**

- Anti-ship fire controls need moderate tracking (matching enemy warship speeds)
- Point defense fire controls need maximum tracking speed (matching missile speeds)
- The same beam weapon can be assigned to different fire controls for different roles
- Higher tracking speed technology does not increase fire control size -- always research it

**Crew Training Effect**

Poorly trained crews suffer accuracy penalties. A green crew at 50% training effectively halves the fire control's tracking capability. This makes crew training one of the most important "invisible" combat multipliers.

**Multiple Shots and Rate of Fire**

High rate of fire weapons (especially with capacitor recharge technology) get multiple chances to hit per combat tick. Even at low hit probability, throwing many dice improves the chance of at least one hit. This is why gauss cannons (which fire many projectiles per burst) are effective point defense despite their individually low accuracy against fast missiles.

**Practical Tips**

- Never pair offensive weapons with PD-grade fire controls (or vice versa) unless you want a dual-purpose system
- Track the speed of your expected enemies and design fire controls to match
- Against very fast targets, multiple low-damage hits (gauss) are more reliable than single high-damage shots (lasers)
- Remember that target speed is the limiting factor: you cannot hit what you cannot track, no matter how powerful your weapons
- Commander selection matters: a skilled tactical officer provides noticeable accuracy bonuses
