# 12.3 Missiles

Missiles are the primary long-range offensive weapon in Aurora. Unlike beam weapons, missiles can strike targets hundreds of millions of kilometers away, but they can be intercepted by point defense, require ammunition, and take time to reach their targets. Missile design is one of the deepest subsystems in Aurora, with dozens of parameters that determine a missile's effectiveness.

## 12.3.1 Missile Design

Missiles are designed in the Missile Design window and can be customized across multiple parameters. The fundamental trade-off in missile design is between speed, range, warhead size, agility, and sensor capability -- all constrained by the missile's total size.

**Missile Size**

Missiles are measured in Missile Size Points (MSP), which range from 1 to 50+. The missile's size determines what launcher can fire it and how many can be stored in a magazine:

| Missile Size | Typical Role | Launcher Size |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1-2 MSP | Anti-missile missiles (AMMs) | Size 1-2 launcher |
| 3-6 MSP | Anti-ship missiles (light) | Size 3-6 launcher |
| 6-12 MSP | Anti-ship missiles (standard) | Size 6-12 launcher |
| 12-20 MSP | Heavy anti-ship missiles | Size 12-20 launcher |
| 20+ MSP | Bombardment/Capital missiles | Size 20+ launcher |

A launcher can only fire missiles of its exact size or smaller. Larger launchers can fire smaller missiles but not vice versa.

**Speed**

Missile speed is determined by the engine technology and the proportion of the missile devoted to propulsion:

```
Missile Speed = Engine Power / Missile Size (in MSP)
```

The engine component uses a percentage of the missile's total MSP. More engine = faster missile but less room for warhead, fuel, and sensors. Key speed considerations:

- Faster missiles are harder to intercept by point defense (PD tracking speed must match)
- Faster missiles reach their targets sooner, giving less time for PD engagement
- Speed directly affects whether the missile can catch a fleeing target

**Warhead**

The warhead determines how much damage the missile inflicts on impact:

```
Warhead Damage = Warhead Size (MSP) * Warhead Strength technology
```

Warhead technology levels increase damage per MSP invested. The warhead size is the MSP allocated to the warhead component. Larger warheads do more damage but leave less room for speed, range, and sensors.

**Fuel and Range**

Missile fuel determines how far the missile can travel before exhausting its propellant:

```
Missile Range = Fuel Amount / (Fuel Consumption Rate * Missile Speed)
```

In practice, the Missile Design window displays the maximum range directly. Key points:

- Range is expressed in millions of km
- A missile that runs out of fuel does not self-destruct -- it continues ballistically but can no longer maneuver
- Fuel-depleted missiles cannot course-correct and will likely miss maneuvering targets

**Agility**

Missile agility (also called maneuverability or ECM resistance) determines how well the missile can adjust its course and resist electronic countermeasures. Higher agility means:

- Better chance of hitting maneuvering targets
- More resistance to enemy ECM
- Generally requires more engine allocation

Agility is expressed in km/s^2 and represents the missile's ability to change direction.

**Onboard Sensors**

Missiles can be equipped with their own active sensors, allowing them to guide themselves to the target independently of the launching ship's fire control:

- **No sensor:** Missile relies entirely on the launching ship's MFC for guidance. If it loses fire control lock, it goes ballistic.
- **Active sensor:** Missile can acquire and track targets independently. The sensor size and resolution determine acquisition range.
- **Home-on-Jam (HOJ):** Missile homes on ECM emissions. Effective against ships using electronic countermeasures.

Onboard sensors consume MSP and generate EM emissions, making the missile more detectable.

**Design Examples**

*Fast Anti-Ship Missile (Size 6):*
- Engine: 3 MSP (50% of size) -- very fast
- Warhead: 1.5 MSP -- moderate damage
- Fuel: 1 MSP -- medium range
- Sensor: 0.5 MSP -- small active seeker
- Speed: Very high, hard to intercept

*Heavy Strike Missile (Size 12):*
- Engine: 4 MSP (33% of size) -- moderate speed
- Warhead: 5 MSP -- devastating damage
- Fuel: 2 MSP -- long range
- Sensor: 1 MSP -- good active seeker
- Damage: Very high, can one-shot smaller ships

## 12.3.2 Missile Combat

Missile combat in Aurora occurs in phases: launch, flight, interception attempts by defenders, and terminal attack. Understanding each phase is essential for effective missile warfare.

**Launch**

Missiles are launched from missile launchers assigned to missile fire controls. The launch process:

1. Fire control acquires and locks a target
2. Launchers assigned to that fire control load missiles from magazines
3. On the fire order, all ready launchers fire simultaneously
4. Launchers begin reloading from magazines (reload time depends on launcher technology)

**Reload Rate**

Standard launchers reload in a base time determined by their size and the Launcher Reload Rate technology:

```
Reload Time = Base Reload Time / Reload Rate Multiplier
```

Reload rate multipliers from technology range from 1 (base) up to 5 or higher. Faster reload means more sustained fire but the technology is expensive to research.

**Box Launchers**

Box launchers are single-use missile tubes that cannot reload. They fire once and are then empty for the rest of the engagement (unless the ship returns to port or a tender for rearming). Advantages:

- Half the size of a standard launcher
- No magazine space needed (missile is pre-loaded)
- Fire simultaneously for a devastating alpha strike

Disadvantages:
- One shot only
- Cannot be reloaded in combat
- Ship must carry many box launchers for sustained fire

**Missile Flight**

After launch, missiles fly toward their target:

- Missiles accelerate to their maximum speed immediately
- They consume fuel while maneuvering
- If the fire control maintains lock, missiles receive course updates
- If fire control lock is lost, missiles fly to the last known target position
- Missiles with onboard sensors can reacquire independently

**Salvo Doctrine**

Missiles are most effective when launched in large salvos:

- Point defense can only engage a limited number of missiles per combat tick
- A salvo of 50 missiles overwhelms PD that can kill 10 per tick
- Timing salvos to arrive simultaneously (even from multiple ships) maximizes the number that leak through PD
- Overkill (more missiles than needed) is preferable to under-committing and losing all missiles to PD

**Terminal Phase**

When missiles reach their target:

1. Each missile that survives PD rolls for a hit based on missile agility vs. target maneuverability
2. Hits apply warhead damage to the target
3. Damage resolution follows standard rules (see Section 12.6)
4. Multiple hits from a salvo are resolved sequentially

**Missile Endurance**

Missiles have limited fuel. If a target evades long enough for missiles to exhaust their fuel:

- Missiles can no longer maneuver
- They continue on their last trajectory
- A maneuvering target will likely evade fuel-depleted missiles
- This makes missile range vs. target distance a critical consideration

**Practical Tips**

- Always launch in the largest salvos possible -- small salvos are efficiently killed by PD
- Size your magazines for multiple engagements, not just one salvo
- Consider mixed salvos: fast missiles to saturate PD followed by heavy missiles for damage
- Missile speed should exceed target speed or the missile can never catch it
- Onboard sensors prevent wasted missiles when fire control is jammed or outranged
- Keep reload time in mind: your first salvo is free, but subsequent salvos depend on launcher reload speed

## 12.3.3 Anti-Missile Missiles

Anti-Missile Missiles (AMMs) are small, fast missiles designed to intercept incoming enemy missiles before they reach their targets. They form the long-range layer of a defensive system.

**AMM Design Philosophy**

AMMs differ from offensive missiles in several key ways:

- **Small size (1-2 MSP):** Maximizes magazine capacity and launcher density
- **Very high speed:** Must be faster than the incoming missiles to intercept
- **Minimal warhead (1 damage):** Only needs to destroy a missile, not a ship
- **Maximum agility:** Must match the agility of incoming missiles for reliable hits
- **Short range:** Only needs to reach incoming missiles within the defensive envelope

A typical AMM design:
- Size: 1 MSP
- Engine: 0.6 MSP (60% devoted to speed)
- Warhead: 0.1 MSP (minimum viable)
- Fuel: 0.2 MSP (short range -- missiles are close when engaged)
- Sensor: 0.1 MSP (small active seeker for terminal guidance)

**AMM Fire Controls**

AMMs require missile fire controls with resolution 1 (50 tons) to engage missile-sized targets. These fire controls have short absolute range due to their low resolution, but missiles are engaged at close range anyway. Key requirements:

- Resolution 1 for missile-sized targets
- Sufficient range to cover the defensive engagement envelope
- The fire control must be active (generating EM) to guide AMMs

**Engagement Sequence**

1. Incoming missiles are detected by sensors (active or passive)
2. AMM fire control acquires incoming missiles as targets
3. AMMs launch toward incoming missiles
4. AMM active seekers acquire targets for terminal guidance
5. Each AMM that catches a missile rolls to hit based on agility matchup
6. Hit AMMs destroy or damage the incoming missile

**AMM vs. Missile Matchup**

The effectiveness of AMMs depends on:

- **Speed differential:** AMMs must be faster than incoming missiles to catch them
- **Agility:** AMM agility must match or exceed missile agility for reliable kills
- **Numbers:** One AMM per incoming missile at minimum; redundancy improves kill rate
- **Engagement time:** Longer time between AMM launch and missile impact = more intercept opportunities

**Magazine Capacity**

AMMs are small, so magazines can hold many of them. A magazine holding 10 standard size-6 missiles can hold 60 size-1 AMMs. This volume advantage is critical: you need many AMMs to reliably stop large incoming salvos.

**AMM Launcher Configuration**

Dedicate specific launchers to AMMs:

- Size-1 launchers for size-1 AMMs
- Maximum reload rate technology
- Multiple launchers per fire control for rapid response
- Consider box launchers for a large initial defensive volley

**Layered Defense: AMMs + CIWS**

The optimal defense combines AMMs (long-range layer) with CIWS/point defense beams (close-range layer):

1. AMMs engage at medium range (100,000-500,000 km), thinning the salvo
2. Area-defense beam weapons engage survivors at 10,000-50,000 km
3. Final-fire CIWS engages at point-blank range (10,000 km)
4. Any missiles surviving all three layers hit the ship

**Practical Tips**

- Design AMMs to be faster than any missile your enemy is likely to build
- Carry at least 3x as many AMMs as you expect to face in a single enemy salvo
- Size-1 AMMs with maximum speed are nearly always better than larger, slower interceptors
- AMM fire control range limits your defensive envelope -- make it large enough for multiple engagement passes
- If enemy missiles have onboard ECM, consider designing AMMs with Home-on-Jam capability
- Test your AMM effectiveness in combat simulations before relying on them in a real engagement
