# 12.5 Electronic Warfare

Electronic warfare (EW) in Aurora encompasses systems that degrade enemy sensor and fire control performance while protecting your own. The two primary components are ECM (Electronic Countermeasures), which reduces the effective range of enemy sensors and fire controls, and ECCM (Electronic Counter-Countermeasures), which resists enemy ECM effects. EW does not prevent detection or guarantee misses, but it shifts the odds meaningfully in large engagements.

## 12.5.1 ECM

Electronic Countermeasures are ship-mounted systems that reduce the effective range at which enemy active sensors (including missile fire controls) can detect and track your ship. ECM represents jamming, signal spoofing, and electronic noise generation.

**How ECM Works**

ECM reduces the effective range of all enemy active sensors attempting to detect or track the ECM-equipped ship. The reduction is expressed as a percentage:

```
Effective Enemy Sensor Range = Base Sensor Range * (1 - ECM Percentage)
```

ECM levels are determined by research in the Electronic Warfare technology tree:

| Technology | ECM Reduction |
|-----------|--------------|
| ECM-1 | 10% reduction |
| ECM-2 | 20% reduction |
| ECM-3 | 30% reduction |
| ECM-4 | 40% reduction |
| ECM-5 | 50% reduction |
| ECM-6 | 60% reduction |

**ECM Component Design**

ECM modules are designed in the Component Design window:

- **Size:** ECM components are typically 1 HS (50 tons)
- **Level:** Determined by the ECM technology researched
- **Multiple modules:** A ship can mount multiple ECM modules, but their effects do not stack additively. Only the highest single ECM level applies to the ship.
- **EM Signature:** ECM modules contribute to the ship's EM signature when active, since they are actively broadcasting jamming signals

**What ECM Affects**

ECM specifically reduces the range of:

1. **Enemy active sensors** attempting to detect the ECM ship
2. **Enemy missile fire controls** attempting to maintain lock on the ECM ship
3. **Missile onboard sensors** attempting to acquire the ECM ship

ECM does NOT affect:
- Passive sensors (thermal and EM detection is unaffected by ECM)
- The ship's own sensors
- Beam fire control accuracy (tracking speed is not affected)
- Friendly ships in the same task group

**ECM and Missile Combat**

ECM's most significant impact is on missile warfare:

- If ECM reduces the enemy MFC range below the actual engagement distance, the MFC loses lock
- Missiles guided by a fire control that loses lock will go ballistic
- Missiles with onboard active sensors are also affected: their acquisition range is reduced by the target's ECM
- This can cause missiles to fly past their target without acquiring it

**Example:** An enemy MFC has 200 million km range against your ship class. Your ship mounts ECM-4 (40% reduction):
- Effective enemy MFC range vs. your ship: 200M * 0.6 = 120M km
- If the enemy launched missiles from 150M km, their fire control loses lock at 120M km
- Missiles must then rely on onboard sensors (also reduced by your ECM) or go ballistic

**ECM and EM Signature Trade-off**

ECM generates EM signature, making your ship more detectable by passive EM sensors. This creates a paradox: ECM reduces active sensor detection range but increases passive EM detection range. Consider:

- Against enemies using primarily active sensors: ECM is highly valuable
- Against enemies using primarily passive EM sensors: ECM can be counterproductive
- In practice, most enemies use both, so ECM is generally worth the EM cost

**Tactical Use of ECM**

- Activate ECM when entering missile engagement range to degrade enemy fire control
- Keep ECM off during approach if you want to minimize EM signature
- ECM is most valuable on ships likely to be targeted by missiles
- Ships that already have high EM signatures (active sensors, shields) gain relatively less from ECM stealth considerations
- Consider ECM on missile ships that will be targeted as threats -- the ECM buys time for additional salvos

## 12.5.2 ECCM

Electronic Counter-Countermeasures resist the effects of enemy ECM on your own sensors and fire controls. ECCM is the defensive side of electronic warfare, protecting your detection and targeting capabilities.

**How ECCM Works**

ECCM reduces the effectiveness of enemy ECM against your sensors. The interaction formula is:

```
Effective ECM = Enemy ECM Level - Your ECCM Level
```

If your ECCM equals or exceeds the enemy's ECM, their jamming is completely negated. If your ECCM is lower, the residual difference applies as reduced ECM effectiveness.

**Example:**
- Enemy has ECM-4 (40% range reduction)
- Your sensors have ECCM-2 (negates 20% of ECM)
- Net ECM effect: 40% - 20% = 20% range reduction on your sensors

**ECCM Implementation**

ECCM is applied to individual sensors and fire controls during the design phase:

- Each active sensor component can include an ECCM rating
- Each beam fire control can include ECCM
- ECCM is built into the component at design time and cannot be changed afterward
- Adding ECCM increases component size proportionally

**ECCM Size Cost**

Adding ECCM to a sensor or fire control increases its size:

```
Component Size with ECCM = Base Size * (1 + ECCM Level * Size Multiplier)
```

Higher ECCM levels make components larger, consuming more hull space. This creates a design trade-off: better ECM resistance at the cost of hull capacity for other systems.

**When to Use ECCM**

ECCM is most valuable when:

- You expect to face enemies with significant ECM capability
- Your missile fire controls need to maintain lock at maximum range
- Your search sensors must detect ECM-equipped ships reliably
- You are designing dedicated anti-ECM platforms

ECCM is less valuable when:

- The enemy does not use ECM (common in early game against NPRs)
- Your engagement doctrine is short-range (ECM range reduction matters less at close range)
- Hull space is at an extreme premium and you cannot afford the size increase

**ECCM on Different Components**

| Component | ECCM Benefit |
|-----------|-------------|
| Search Sensors | Maintains detection range against ECM targets |
| Missile Fire Controls | Maintains guidance range against ECM targets |
| Beam Fire Controls | Limited benefit (ECM primarily affects range, not tracking) |

**Design Recommendations**

- Always include ECCM on missile fire controls if you expect ECM threats
- Search sensors benefit from ECCM but the size cost may not be justified on every ship
- Match ECCM level to expected enemy ECM level -- over-investing wastes hull space
- A dedicated sensor ship with high-ECCM sensors can provide detection data to the entire fleet
- If you face an unknown enemy, moderate ECCM (level 2-3) is a reasonable hedge

## 12.5.3 Jamming Effects

Understanding how ECM and ECCM interact in practice helps predict combat outcomes and design effective fleets. The effects cascade through multiple systems and can determine the winner of a missile exchange.

**Effect on Detection Ranges**

When a target has ECM and your sensors have ECCM, the net effect on detection range:

```
Net Detection Range = Base Range * (1 - max(0, Enemy_ECM - Your_ECCM) * 0.1)
```

Where ECM and ECCM values are integer levels (1-6 typically).

This means:
- ECM-3 vs. ECCM-0: 30% range reduction
- ECM-5 vs. ECCM-3: 20% range reduction
- ECM-4 vs. ECCM-4: 0% range reduction (fully countered)
- ECM-2 vs. ECCM-5: 0% range reduction (ECCM exceeds ECM)

**Effect on Missile Engagement**

The most tactically significant EW interaction occurs during missile combat:

1. **Launch phase:** MFC range vs. ECM-equipped target determines maximum launch range
2. **Mid-course:** If target ECM reduces MFC effective range below current distance, fire control loses lock
3. **Terminal phase:** Missile onboard sensors reduced by target ECM may fail to acquire
4. **Result:** Missiles miss entirely if they cannot maintain or reacquire lock

**Scenario Analysis**

*Without EW:*
- Your MFC range: 200M km
- Missile range: 180M km
- Launch at 180M km, fire control guides to impact
- Result: Full salvo on target

*Target has ECM-4, you have no ECCM:*
- Effective MFC range: 200M * 0.6 = 120M km
- Missile range: 180M km
- Launch at 120M km (limited by MFC), fire control guides to impact
- Result: Reduced launch range, target has more warning time

*Target has ECM-4, you have ECCM-2:*
- Effective ECM: 4 - 2 = 2 levels = 20% reduction
- Effective MFC range: 200M * 0.8 = 160M km
- Launch at 160M km, fire control guides to impact
- Result: Moderate range reduction, still effective engagement

**Effect on Active Search Sensors**

ECM also affects the range at which your search sensors can detect the ECM-equipped target:

- A fleet with strong ECM can approach closer before being detected
- Your resolution-matched sensor range is reduced by the net ECM percentage
- This can allow ECM-equipped ships to achieve tactical surprise

**Effect on Point Defense**

ECM does not directly affect beam PD tracking speed (tracking is a speed-based calculation, not range-based). However:

- ECM on incoming missiles affects the range at which your active sensors detect them
- Reduced detection range means less warning time and fewer PD engagement windows
- AMM fire controls (active sensors) are affected: reduced range means shorter AMM engagement zone

**Fleet-Level EW Dynamics**

In a fleet engagement, EW creates asymmetric advantages:

- The fleet with better ECM can fight at closer range without being engaged by long-range missiles
- The fleet with better ECCM maintains full sensor and fire control range regardless of enemy ECM
- EW advantage does not guarantee victory but shifts engagement geometry favorably

**EW Arms Race**

ECM and ECCM create a technology arms race:

1. Enemy develops ECM: Your sensors and fire controls lose range
2. You develop ECCM: Counter their ECM, restore your capability
3. Enemy develops better ECM: Overcome your ECCM, degrade you again
4. You develop better ECCM: Counter again

This cycle encourages continuous investment in EW technology. Falling behind in EW technology can make your missiles ineffective even if they are otherwise superior.

**Home-on-Jam (HOJ) Missiles**

HOJ missiles counter ECM by using it as a targeting signal:

- HOJ sensors home on ECM emissions directly
- Stronger enemy ECM makes HOJ missiles MORE effective (stronger signal)
- Forces a dilemma: use ECM and attract HOJ missiles, or turn off ECM and face standard missiles
- HOJ missiles are a strong counter to heavy ECM doctrines

**Practical Tips**

- If you observe enemy ECM in combat, prioritize ECCM research immediately
- Include HOJ capability on some missiles as an ECM counter
- ECM is most cost-effective on missile targets (ships the enemy will fire at)
- ECCM is most cost-effective on missile fire controls (maintains your offensive reach)
- In fleet composition, designate some ships as EW specialists with maximum ECM
- Remember that ECM generates EM signature -- EM-silent approaches require ECM off
- Against opponents without ECM, ECCM investment is wasted hull space
- When unsure about enemy capability, moderate EW investment hedges effectively
