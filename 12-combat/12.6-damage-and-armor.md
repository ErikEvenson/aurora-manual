# 12.6 Damage and Armor

When weapons hit their targets, Aurora resolves damage through a detailed system that models armor penetration, internal component destruction, crew casualties, and secondary effects. Understanding this system is essential for both designing survivable ships and selecting weapons that can defeat enemy armor.

## 12.6.1 Damage Resolution

Each hit in Aurora is resolved individually against the target ship's defenses. The process follows a sequence: first checking shields, then armor penetration, then internal damage if the armor is breached.

**Damage Resolution Sequence**

1. **Shield Check:** If the target has active shields, they absorb damage first. Each point of shield strength absorbs one point of damage. Shields regenerate over time.
2. **Hit Location:** A random armor column is selected. The ship's armor is divided into columns corresponding to hull sections.
3. **Armor Penetration Check:** The weapon's damage (which also represents its penetration value) is compared against the armor depth at that column.
4. **Armor Damage:** The weapon reduces armor at the hit column. Each point of damage destroys one layer of armor at that location.
5. **Internal Damage:** If the weapon's damage exceeds the remaining armor depth, excess damage penetrates to internal components.

**Shields**

Shields are the first line of defense and absorb damage before it reaches armor:

```
Damage to Armor = max(0, Incoming Damage - Current Shield Strength)
```

Shield characteristics:
- Shields absorb damage point-for-point
- Shields regenerate at a rate determined by shield technology and the number of shield generators
- Shields produce EM signature while active (see Section 11.1.2)
- Shield strength is shared across all hit locations (not per-column)
- A single large hit can deplete shields entirely, allowing remaining damage through

**Armor System**

Armor in Aurora is modeled as a grid of columns and layers:

```
Armor Grid = Columns (based on hull size) x Depth (layers of armor)
```

- **Columns:** The number of armor columns is determined by the ship's hull size. Larger ships have more columns, spreading hits across more locations.
- **Depth:** The number of armor layers is set during ship design. More layers = more protection but more mass and cost.
- **Per-column tracking:** Armor damage is tracked per column. A hit at column 5 only damages column 5's armor, leaving other columns intact.

**Armor Penetration**

A weapon's penetration value equals its damage value. To breach armor:

```
If Weapon Damage > Armor Depth at hit column:
    Internal Damage = Weapon Damage - Armor Depth
    Armor at that column = 0
Else:
    Armor at that column -= Weapon Damage
    No internal damage occurs
```

This means:
- Low-damage weapons cannot penetrate thick armor regardless of how many hit
- Each hit at the same column progressively thins that column's armor
- Multiple hits at different columns spread damage without penetrating
- A single high-damage weapon can breach in one shot where many small weapons cannot

**Range and Penetration**

Beam weapons lose damage (and therefore penetration) at range. A 20-damage laser at 50% range does only 10 damage, meaning it can only penetrate 10 layers of armor. This is why closing range is critical when facing heavily armored opponents.

**Missile Warhead Penetration**

Missile warheads apply their full damage value regardless of the range they traveled. A missile with a 10-damage warhead always has penetration 10, making missiles more consistent against armor than beam weapons at long range.

**Damage Types**

Different weapon types interact with armor differently:

| Weapon | Armor Interaction |
|--------|-------------------|
| Lasers | Standard penetration, reduced by range |
| Railguns | Standard penetration, does not reduce with range |
| Plasma Carronades | High damage, very short range, standard penetration |
| Mesons | Bypasses armor entirely (damages internals directly) |
| Microwaves | Bypasses armor, targets crew specifically |
| Gauss Cannons | 1 damage per shot, cannot penetrate meaningful armor |
| Missile Warheads | Full damage regardless of flight distance |

## 12.6.2 Internal Damage

When a weapon penetrates armor, excess damage is applied to internal components. Internal damage is the primary means of disabling and destroying ships in Aurora.

**Component Hit Determination**

When internal damage occurs, the game randomly selects which internal components are hit based on their relative size. Larger components are more likely to be hit:

```
Hit Probability for Component = Component Size (HS) / Total Internal HS
```

This means:
- Large engines are frequently hit
- Small sensors or fire controls are rarely hit directly
- Fuel tanks, when present, are proportionally likely targets

**Component Destruction**

Each internal component has a hit points value (typically 1 per HS of component size). When hit:

- Component takes 1 point of damage per point of penetrating damage
- If total damage equals or exceeds component HP, the component is destroyed
- Destroyed components cease to function immediately
- Partially damaged components still function normally until destroyed

**Critical Components**

Some component hits have catastrophic effects:

| Component | Effect When Destroyed |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| Engineering Spaces | Reduced damage control capability |
| Fuel Tanks | Fuel leak (ongoing fuel loss), potential explosion |
| Magazines | Potential magazine detonation (catastrophic explosion) |
| Engines | Reduced speed proportional to engine loss |
| Power Plants | Reduced power generation |
| Bridge | Ship loses command capability |
| Sensors | Loss of detection in that sensor's band |
| Fire Controls | Weapons assigned lose targeting |
| Life Support | Crew begins taking casualties over time |

**Magazine Detonation**

Magazine hits are the most feared internal damage result. When a magazine is hit:

- There is a chance of sympathetic detonation of stored ordnance
- Detonation chance depends on magazine armor and the severity of the hit
- A magazine detonation typically destroys the ship instantly
- Magazine armor (a component option during design) reduces detonation probability
- Empty magazines cannot detonate

**Secondary Explosions**

Fuel tank hits can cause fires and secondary explosions:

- Fuel leaks reduce available fuel over time
- In severe cases, fuel ignition can cause additional internal damage
- Fuel tank hits are more dangerous on ships carrying large fuel reserves

**Crew Casualties**

Internal hits cause crew casualties proportional to the damage:

- Each penetrating hit kills crew members
- Crew losses reduce the ship's operational efficiency
- Sufficient crew losses can render a ship combat-ineffective
- Crew grade and morale affect combat performance even before total loss

**Microwave Weapon Effects**

Microwave weapons bypass armor and specifically target crew:

- Each hit kills crew without damaging components
- Extremely effective against lightly-crewed ships
- Countered only by armor (which microwaves bypass) or by having very large crews
- Used strategically to disable ships while preserving them for capture

**Meson Weapon Effects**

Meson weapons pass through all physical barriers:

- Bypass shields entirely
- Bypass armor entirely
- Damage internal components directly
- Lower damage per shot compared to equivalent-size lasers
- Cannot be defended against except by destroying the firing ship

## 12.6.3 Repair and Damage Control

Ships in Aurora can repair damage using their engineering sections and maintenance supplies. Damage control is the difference between a ship limping home for full repair and being abandoned in deep space.

**Engineering Sections**

Engineering spaces (also called Damage Control sections) provide repair capability:

- Each engineering section contributes repair capacity
- More engineering sections = faster repairs
- Engineering sections can themselves be damaged, reducing repair speed
- Ships without engineering sections cannot repair at all

**Damage Control Process**

Repairs are performed automatically during time advancement:

1. The ship's damage control crew assesses damaged components
2. Repairs are attempted based on engineering capacity and available supplies
3. Each repair cycle can fix a portion of damage based on crew skill and engineering rating
4. Armor cannot be repaired in the field (requires a shipyard)
5. Destroyed components can be repaired to functional status given enough time and supplies

**Maintenance Supplies**

Repairs consume Maintenance Supply Points (MSP):

- Each repair operation uses MSP proportional to the component being repaired
- Ships carry MSP in dedicated storage
- When MSP is exhausted, no further repairs can be made
- MSP can be resupplied from maintenance-capable ships or colonies

```
MSP Usage per Repair = Component Size * Repair Complexity Factor
```

**Repair Priorities**

The damage control system prioritizes repairs automatically:

1. Life-threatening damage (life support, fuel leaks)
2. Propulsion (engines, to restore mobility)
3. Weapons and fire controls
4. Sensors
5. Non-critical systems

Players cannot manually set repair priorities -- the system handles this automatically. However, understanding the priority order helps predict which systems come back online first.

**Field Repair vs. Shipyard Repair**

| Repair Type | Capability |
|-------------|-----------|
| Field (Engineering) | Repairs components to functional; cannot repair armor |
| Tender/Supply Ship | Provides MSP resupply; same repair limitations |
| Shipyard | Full repair including armor; complete component replacement |
| Orbital Station | Depends on station capabilities |

**Armor Repair**

Armor damage cannot be repaired by shipboard engineering. A ship with depleted armor columns must return to a shipyard for armor restoration. This makes armor a non-renewable resource in combat -- once it is gone, the ship becomes progressively more vulnerable to subsequent hits.

**Crew and Repair Speed**

Repair speed is affected by:

- **Engineering section capacity:** More sections = faster
- **Crew training:** Better-trained crews repair faster
- **Commander skill:** Engineering-skilled commanders provide bonuses
- **Available MSP:** No supplies = no repairs
- **Damage severity:** More damage overall means repairs take longer (more to fix)

**Maintenance and Reliability**

Beyond combat damage, ships require ongoing maintenance:

- Ships accumulate maintenance clock time based on distance traveled and time deployed
- Components can fail randomly as maintenance clock increases
- Maintenance failures are repaired using the same system as combat damage
- Regular maintenance at shipyards resets the maintenance clock
- Ships deployed for extended periods without maintenance become unreliable

**Design Tips for Survivability**

- Include at least 1-2 engineering sections on every warship
- Carry sufficient MSP for expected combat duration (plan for multiple engagements)
- Consider magazine armor to prevent catastrophic detonation
- Distribute critical systems (do not put all fire controls on one ship if possible)
- Armor depth should exceed the expected weapon damage of your opponents
- Redundant engines ensure a crippled ship can still limp home
- Ships expecting extended deployments need larger MSP reserves
- A dedicated repair/tender ship supporting a battle group provides MSP resupply and extends combat endurance
