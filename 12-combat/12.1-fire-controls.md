# 12.1 Fire Controls

Fire controls are the targeting systems that direct weapons to their targets. In Aurora C#, no weapon can fire without an assigned fire control, making them as essential as the weapons themselves. There are two distinct types: beam fire controls (BFCs) for directing energy weapons and point defense, and missile fire controls (MFCs) for guiding missile attacks. Each type has different design parameters and tactical considerations.

## 12.1.1 Beam Fire Controls

Beam Fire Controls (BFCs) direct lasers, railguns, plasma carronades, mesons, microwaves, and gauss cannons to their targets. Their two key parameters are tracking speed and maximum range.

**Design Parameters**

When designing a BFC in the Component Design window, you set:

- **Range:** The maximum distance at which the fire control can engage targets. Determined by the Beam Fire Control Range technology. Ranges start at 10,000 km and increase with research.
- **Tracking Speed:** The maximum speed of target the fire control can accurately track, expressed in km/s. Determined by the Fire Control Speed Rating technology.
- **Size:** BFC size is fixed at 1 HS (50 tons) for standard beam fire controls. Smaller versions (0.5 HS) are available at reduced range and tracking speed for use on fighters and FACs.

**Range Technology**

The Fire Control Range technology determines maximum engagement distance:

| Tech Level | Max Range |
|-----------|-----------|
| Fire Control Range 10,000 km | 10,000 km |
| Fire Control Range 20,000 km | 20,000 km |
| Fire Control Range 40,000 km | 40,000 km |
| Fire Control Range 80,000 km | 80,000 km |
| Fire Control Range 160,000 km | 160,000 km |
| Fire Control Range 320,000 km | 320,000 km |

The fire control range should match or exceed the range of the beam weapons assigned to it. A fire control with 80,000 km range paired with a laser that reaches 160,000 km wastes half the weapon's potential. Conversely, fire control range exceeding weapon range provides no benefit.

**Tracking Speed and Hit Probability**

Tracking speed is critical for determining hit probability. The base chance to hit is:

```
Base Hit Chance = Fire Control Tracking Speed / Target Speed
```

This value is capped at 100% (1.0). If the target is moving faster than your fire control can track, accuracy degrades linearly.

**Examples:**
- FC tracking 10,000 km/s vs. target at 5,000 km/s = 100% base accuracy
- FC tracking 10,000 km/s vs. target at 20,000 km/s = 50% base accuracy
- FC tracking 5,000 km/s vs. target at 25,000 km/s = 20% base accuracy

Additional modifiers apply to this base chance (see Section 12.2.3 for full hit probability calculation).

**Weapon Assignment**

Each BFC can have multiple beam weapons assigned to it, but they all fire at the same target. When the fire control fires, all assigned weapons fire simultaneously. Considerations:

- Assigning more weapons to fewer fire controls means less target flexibility
- One weapon per fire control maximizes target options but uses more hull space
- A common compromise: group weapons by type on shared fire controls

**Fire Control Modes**

BFCs can be set to different operating modes:

- **Open Fire:** Fires at any valid target within range
- **Point Defense (Final Fire):** Only fires at missiles/fighters in the final defense zone (10,000 km or less)
- **Point Defense (Area):** Fires at missiles/fighters within the fire control's full range
- **Hold Fire:** Assigned but not firing

## 12.1.2 Missile Fire Controls

Missile Fire Controls (MFCs) are active sensors assigned to guide missiles to their targets. Unlike beam fire controls which are fixed-size dedicated components, missile fire controls are designed as active sensors with specific resolution and range characteristics.

**Design as Active Sensors**

MFCs are designed in the Component Design window under Active Sensors. Any active sensor can serve as a missile fire control -- you assign it that role in the tactical window. The sensor's properties directly determine the fire control's capabilities:

- **Resolution:** Determines the size of target the fire control can effectively engage
- **Range:** The maximum distance at which the fire control maintains lock on a target
- **Size:** Larger sensors provide longer range but cost more hull space and generate more EM

See Section 11.3.3 for detailed mechanics of active sensors as fire controls.

**MFC Range vs. Missile Range**

The fire control must maintain a sensor lock on the target for the entire duration of missile flight (unless the missiles have onboard active sensors). This creates a fundamental design constraint:

```
Effective Missile Range = min(MFC Range vs. Target, Missile Kinetic Range)
```

If your MFC cannot detect the target at the range where your missiles would reach it, the missiles cannot receive guidance updates and will go ballistic (flying to the last known position).

**Resolution Matching**

The MFC's resolution must match the intended targets:

- **Anti-ship MFC (resolution 50-500):** Long range against warships, standard for fleet engagements
- **Anti-FAC MFC (resolution 5-20):** Medium range against small craft
- **Anti-missile MFC (resolution 1):** Short range, used for guiding anti-missile missiles (AMMs)

A resolution mismatch dramatically reduces effective engagement range. A resolution-100 MFC trying to guide missiles against a 500-ton target will lose lock at approximately 10% of its rated range.

**Multiple MFCs and Target Allocation**

Each MFC can engage one target at a time. Standard fleet doctrine includes:

- 1 MFC per intended simultaneous target
- Missile launchers are assigned to specific MFCs
- When an MFC's target is destroyed, it can be reassigned to a new target
- Multiple MFCs can engage the same target (useful for concentrating fire)

**Practical Tips**

- Design MFCs with range matching your longest-range missiles
- Include at least one resolution-1 MFC on any ship that carries AMMs
- Remember that MFCs generate EM signature -- turning them on announces your offensive intent
- Test your MFC detection range against expected target sizes before committing to a design
- For mixed fleets, centralize MFCs on dedicated missile platforms rather than distributing them

## 12.1.3 Point Defense Mode

Point defense (PD) mode converts beam weapons from offensive tools into defensive systems that automatically engage incoming missiles and fighters. This is configured through fire control settings and is one of the most important defensive mechanisms in Aurora.

**Setting Up Point Defense**

To configure point defense:

1. Assign beam weapons to a Beam Fire Control
2. Set the fire control to one of the PD modes:
   - **Point Defense (Final Fire):** Engages targets within 10,000 km only
   - **Point Defense (Area):** Engages targets out to the fire control's maximum range

3. The weapons will then automatically fire at incoming missiles or hostile fighters each combat tick

**Final Fire vs. Area Defense**

| Mode | Range | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Final Fire | 10,000 km | Maximum accuracy (close range) | Single intercept window |
| Area Defense | Full FC range | Multiple engagement opportunities | Lower accuracy at long range |

**Final Fire** is appropriate for:
- Gauss cannons (short range, high rate of fire)
- Ships with limited PD weapons that need maximum kill probability per shot
- Last-ditch defense against leaked missiles

**Area Defense** is appropriate for:
- Lasers with long range
- Ships that want to thin out missile salvos at distance
- Covering other ships in the task group

**Point Defense Priority**

When multiple missiles threaten a task group, the PD system prioritizes:

1. Missiles targeting the PD ship itself
2. Missiles targeting other ships in the same task group
3. Missiles that are closest (shortest time to impact)

**Fleet Point Defense**

Ships set to area point defense can protect other ships in their task group, not just themselves. This enables dedicated PD escorts that shield high-value ships. A common fleet composition includes:

- Capital ships with offensive weapons
- PD escorts with gauss cannons and/or point defense lasers set to area defense
- The PD escorts engage incoming missiles before they reach the capital ships

**Fire Control Tracking Speed for PD**

Point defense effectiveness against missiles depends heavily on tracking speed. Missiles in Aurora can be extremely fast (10,000+ km/s at higher tech levels). Your PD fire control tracking speed must match or exceed missile speeds for reliable intercepts:

```
PD Hit Chance = min(1.0, FC Tracking Speed / Missile Speed) * other modifiers
```

Design PD fire controls with the highest available tracking speed technology, even if this limits range (PD engages at close range anyway).

**Dual-Purpose Fire Controls**

A single fire control can be switched between offensive and PD modes during combat. This allows:

- Using beam weapons offensively when no missiles threaten
- Switching to PD mode when incoming missiles are detected
- Requires manual intervention (or conditional orders) to switch modes

**Practical Tips**

- Every warship should have at least some PD capability -- a single missile salvo can destroy an undefended ship
- Gauss cannons are the premier PD weapon: cheap, fast-firing, and effective at final-fire range
- Tracking speed is more important than range for PD fire controls
- Area defense provides better fleet protection but uses ammunition/capacitor charge at longer range
- Mix final-fire and area-defense ships for layered protection
- Remember that PD weapons firing at missiles are not available for offensive fire and vice versa
