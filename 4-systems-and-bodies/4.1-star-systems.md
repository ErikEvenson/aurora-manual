# 4.1 Star Systems

## 4.1.1 Star Classification

Aurora C# generates star systems using realistic stellar classification based on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Each star is assigned a spectral type and luminosity class that determines its characteristics and profoundly influences the system it hosts.

### Spectral Types

Stars are classified by spectral type using the standard OBAFGKM sequence, from hottest to coolest:

| Spectral Type | Temperature (K) | Color | Frequency in Aurora |
|---|---|---|---|
| O | 30,000-50,000+ | Blue | Very rare |
| B | 10,000-30,000 | Blue-white | Rare |
| A | 7,500-10,000 | White | Uncommon |
| F | 6,000-7,500 | Yellow-white | Common |
| G | 5,200-6,000 | Yellow | Common (Sol-type) |
| K | 3,700-5,200 | Orange | Very common |
| M | 2,400-3,700 | Red | Most common |

Each spectral type is further subdivided with a numeral from 0-9 (e.g., G2, which is our Sun's classification). Lower numbers indicate hotter stars within the class.

### Luminosity Classes

Luminosity class indicates the star's size and evolutionary state:

- **Ia, Ib** - Supergiants (extremely luminous, rare)
- **II** - Bright giants
- **III** - Giants (evolved stars)
- **IV** - Subgiants (transitioning off main sequence)
- **V** - Main sequence (dwarf stars, most common)
- **VI** - Subdwarfs

### Effects on the System

A star's type directly influences several important gameplay factors:

**Habitable Zone Distance:** Hotter, more luminous stars push the habitable zone further out, while dim M-class stars have very close habitable zones. This affects orbital periods and travel times within the system.

**Number of Planets:** Larger, more luminous stars tend to generate more orbital bodies during system creation, giving players more potential colony sites and resource deposits to exploit.

**System Illumination:** The star's luminosity affects sensor performance within the system. Brighter stars can make thermal detection more difficult due to background radiation.

**Stellar Energy:** Stars with higher luminosity provide more energy for potential future technologies and affect the temperature calculations of orbiting bodies.

### Special Star Types

Aurora also generates several special stellar objects:

- **White Dwarfs** - Collapsed remnants of low-mass stars. Systems around white dwarfs tend to have fewer planets and may contain unusual mineral distributions.
- **Brown Dwarfs (L, T types)** - Sub-stellar objects too small to sustain hydrogen fusion. These generate very dim systems with close-in, cold planets.
- **Neutron Stars/Pulsars** - Extremely dense remnants of massive stars. Rare but can be generated. Systems tend to be sparse.

> **Tip:** When exploring, don't ignore M-class and K-class star systems. While they tend to have closer-in habitable zones, they are by far the most numerous star type and often contain rich mineral deposits.

## 4.1.2 Binary and Trinary Systems

Aurora C# models multi-star systems with realistic orbital mechanics. Approximately 30-40% of generated systems contain more than one star.

### Binary Star Configurations

In a binary system, two stars orbit their common center of mass (barycenter). Aurora models three configurations:

**Close Binaries:** The two stars orbit very close together, effectively acting as a single light source for the purposes of planetary orbits. Planets orbit both stars at a distance. These systems function similarly to single-star systems for gameplay purposes, though the combined luminosity of both stars affects the habitable zone.

**Wide Binaries:** The companion star orbits at a significant distance from the primary. Each star can have its own set of planets in stable orbits. In gameplay terms, this creates two distinct "sub-systems" within a single star system, connected by the system map. Travel between the two stellar groups requires crossing significant distances.

**Intermediate Binaries:** The companion orbits at a moderate distance. Planets may orbit the primary, the secondary, or both (circumbinary orbits), depending on stability calculations.

### Trinary Systems

Trinary (triple) star systems are less common but do occur. Typically, they consist of a close binary pair with a distant tertiary companion, or a primary star with two distant companions. The same orbital principles apply, with planets potentially orbiting individual stars or the system barycenter.

### Gameplay Implications

**Navigation:** Ships traveling within multi-star systems must account for the greater distances between stellar components. A wide binary system can have planets separated by hundreds of AU.

**Jump Points:** Each star in a multi-star system can have its own set of jump points, meaning binary and trinary systems may have more connections to other systems.

**Surveying:** Multi-star systems take longer to fully survey due to the additional bodies and greater distances involved. Plan your gravitational survey missions accordingly.

**Strategic Value:** Wide binary systems with habitable worlds around different stars can be particularly valuable, as they provide multiple colonization targets within a single system entry point.

> **Tip:** When you discover a binary or trinary system, check both stellar components for habitable worlds and mineral-rich bodies. Players often focus on the primary star and overlook excellent colony sites orbiting the companion.

## 4.1.3 System Display

### System Map Window

The primary interface for viewing star systems is the System Map window, accessible from the main toolbar. This window displays the system in a top-down orbital view.

**Key elements of the display:**

- **Central Star(s):** Shown at the center of the map with color indicating spectral type.
- **Orbital Paths:** Displayed as circles or ellipses showing the orbits of planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.
- **Planet Icons:** Bodies are shown with icons that indicate their type (terrestrial, gas giant, asteroid, etc.).
- **Jump Points:** Displayed at their orbital distance from the star, typically at the outer edges of the system.
- **Ship Icons:** Military and civilian vessels appear at their current positions.
- **Colony Markers:** Colonized bodies are highlighted to distinguish them from uncolonized ones.

### Zoom and Navigation

The System Map supports multiple zoom levels:

- **Mouse Wheel:** Zoom in and out smoothly.
- **Right-click Drag:** Pan the view across the system.
- **Double-click:** Center the view on the clicked body or object.
- **Dropdown Selector:** Jump directly to a specific body or fleet in the system.

### Display Filters

The System Map provides several filter options to reduce clutter:

- Toggle visibility of different body types (planets, moons, asteroids, comets)
- Show or hide fleet icons
- Display or hide orbital paths
- Filter by faction ownership
- Show or hide jump points

### System Information Panel

Clicking on any body in the System Map opens an information panel showing:

- Body name and type
- Orbital parameters (semi-major axis, eccentricity, orbital period)
- Physical characteristics (mass, radius, gravity, temperature)
- Atmospheric composition (if applicable)
- Colony information (if colonized)
- Mineral survey results (if surveyed)

### The Galactic Map

For a broader view of explored space, the Galactic Map shows all known star systems and the jump point connections between them. This is essential for strategic planning, route optimization, and understanding the topology of known space. Systems can be color-coded by various criteria including ownership, mineral richness, and habitable world presence.

> **Tip:** Use the Galactic Map frequently to plan expansion routes. Systems with many jump point connections are natural chokepoints that have significant strategic value for defense.
