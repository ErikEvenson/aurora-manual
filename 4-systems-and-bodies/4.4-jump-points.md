# 4.4 Jump Points

Jump points are the fundamental mechanism for interstellar travel in Aurora C#. They connect star systems in pairs, forming the navigable topology of the galaxy. Understanding how to find, traverse, and exploit jump points is central to exploration, commerce, and warfare.

## 4.4.1 Discovery

Jump points are fixed locations in space where the fabric of spacetime is thin enough to allow transit to another star system. Each jump point connects exactly two systems -- when you transit one, you emerge at the paired counterpart in the destination system. Discovering jump points is essential for expanding beyond your home system.

### Gravitational Survey

Jump points are discovered through gravitational surveys conducted by ships equipped with gravitational survey sensors. Unlike geological surveys (which scan individual bodies), gravitational surveys scan fixed points in space distributed throughout the system.

**Survey Process:**
1. Design and build a ship with gravitational survey sensors (found in the ship design component list; see [Section 8.4 Sensors](../8-ship-design/8.4-sensors.md)).
2. Assign the ship to a fleet and set its orders to "Gravitational Survey" for the target system.
3. The ship will automatically navigate to different gravitational survey points within the system.
4. At each survey point, the sensor has a chance of detecting a jump point based on sensor strength and survey time.
5. Once all survey points have been checked, the system's gravitational survey is complete.

**Survey Point Mechanics:**

- Each system has a fixed number of gravitational survey points, determined during system generation.
- Survey points are distributed throughout the system at various distances from the star.
- The ship must physically travel to each point and spend time surveying.
- Larger gravitational survey sensors complete each point faster.

> **Tip:** A discovered jump point's physical location in the system is typically NOT at the survey location that revealed it. Survey locations are simply the points your ship travels to in order to use gravitational fields for detection. The actual jump point will appear at a different position on the system map. Do not confuse survey location markers with jump point locations.

### Standard vs. Hidden Jump Points

Aurora C# features two categories of jump points:

| Type | Detection | Survey Skill Required | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| Standard | Normal gravitational survey | Base sensor capability | Most jump points are standard |
| Hidden | Requires higher survey skill | Enhanced sensor strength or extended survey time | Fewer in number; may remain undetected even after a "complete" standard survey |

**Hidden Jump Points:**

- Hidden jump points have a much lower detection probability per survey increment.
- A system may appear fully surveyed while still containing hidden jump points.
- Higher-tech gravitational survey sensors or commanders with high survey skill ratings improve hidden JP detection.
- Hidden jump points are identical to standard jump points once detected -- the only difference is discovery difficulty.
- Enemies can use hidden jump points you haven't discovered, making them a potential security blind spot.

> **Warning:** A "complete" gravitational survey does not guarantee all hidden jump points have been found. If you suspect a system has hidden connections (e.g., unexplained alien contacts), re-survey with better sensors or higher-skilled officers.

### Detection Probability

The chance of detecting a jump point at a survey point depends on:

- **Sensor Strength:** More powerful gravitational survey sensors have higher detection chances per increment of time.
- **Survey Time:** The longer a ship surveys a point, the higher the cumulative probability of detection. Eventually, a point is considered fully surveyed even if no jump point was found (because no jump point exists there).
- **Jump Point Size:** Larger jump points (those connecting to more massive star systems) are slightly easier to detect.
- **Jump Point Type:** Standard jump points are detected at normal probability; hidden jump points have significantly reduced detection rates.

### Undiscovered Jump Points

It's important to note:

- A system may have jump points that your survey ships haven't found yet if the survey is incomplete.
- Hostile ships can arrive through jump points you haven't discovered, emerging from unknown connections.
- A complete gravitational survey of a system reveals all jump points present.
- Some systems may have no jump points at all beyond the one you entered through (dead ends).

### Survey Ship Design Tips

- **Speed vs. Sensor Size:** Faster survey ships complete surveys sooner because they spend less time in transit between survey points. Balance sensor size with engine power.
- **Range:** Ensure survey ships have enough fuel range to complete a system survey without refueling, especially for larger systems.
- **Multiple Ships:** Assigning multiple survey ships to the same system speeds up the survey, as they will divide the survey points between them.
- **Jump Capability:** Survey ships should either have jump drives (see [Section 8.1 Design Philosophy](../8-ship-design/8.1-design-philosophy.md)) or be accompanied by a jump-capable escort to reach new systems.

> **Tip:** Design your gravitational survey ships early in the game. A fast survey ship with a reasonably sized gravitational sensor and long fuel range will serve you throughout the early and mid-game. The faster you map jump point connections, the sooner you can identify resource-rich systems and potential threats.

## 4.4.2 Transit Mechanics

Transiting a jump point moves a ship (or fleet) instantaneously from one star system to another. However, several mechanics govern how jump transit works.

### Jump Point Pairing

Every jump point exists as one half of a matched pair:

- Each jump point has exactly one counterpart in exactly one other system.
- The pairing is permanent and fixed at system generation -- it cannot be changed (except via Supervisor Mode regeneration; see [Section 4.4.5 Regenerating Jump Points (Supervisor Mode)](#445-regenerating-jump-points-supervisor-mode)).
- Transiting a jump point always delivers you to the same paired endpoint.
- The paired endpoints may be at different distances from their respective system primaries.
- Jump points are bidirectional: you can transit in either direction (subject to gate/drive requirements).

### Jump Drive Requirements

To transit a jump point without a jump gate, a ship requires a jump drive. Jump drives are ship components designed in the Ship Designer (see [Section 8.6 Other Components](../8-ship-design/8.6-other-components.md)).

**Jump Drive Types:**

| Drive Type | Squadron Transit | Size Efficiency | Typical Use |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Military Jump Drive | Yes | Compact | Warships, escorts, jump tenders |
| Commercial Jump Drive | No | Larger per ton moved | Freighters, colony ships, commercial vessels |

- **Military Jump Drives:** Compact drives that allow the equipped ship and its squadron to transit. They have a maximum ship tonnage rating and a squadron transit capability, making them essential for fleet operations in ungated space.
- **Commercial Jump Drives:** Larger but simpler drives designed for commercial vessels. They allow bigger ships to jump but only carry the ship itself (no squadron transit). They are heavier relative to military drives for the same tonnage rating.
- **Jump Drive Tonnage Rating:** The jump drive must be rated for at least the tonnage of the ship it's installed on. A ship with an undersized jump drive cannot transit. Check the drive's rated tonnage in the ship design summary.

**Jump Drive Design Considerations:**

- Drive efficiency improves with technology -- higher-tech drives are smaller for the same tonnage rating.
- Fuel consumption per transit is fixed per drive, regardless of distance (jump transit is instantaneous).
- A ship can mount only one jump drive; multiple drives provide no benefit.
- The decision between military and commercial drives is primarily about squadron transit capability vs. cost/size efficiency for solo jumpers.

### Squadron Transit

A ship with a military jump drive can bring other ships through a jump point with it, using squadron transit. This is the primary mechanism for moving non-jump-capable warships through ungated jump points.

**Squadron Transit Mechanics:**

- **Maximum Squadron Size:** Each military jump drive has a maximum tonnage it can move through the jump point in a single transit. This includes the drive ship itself.
- **Formation:** Ships using squadron transit must be in the same fleet as the jump-capable ship (see [Section 9.1 Shipyards](../9-fleet-management/9.1-shipyards.md) for fleet organization).
- **Timing:** All ships transit simultaneously in a squadron jump.
- **Limitations:** If the total fleet tonnage exceeds the jump drive's squadron transit capacity, multiple jumps are required, with the jump-capable ship making round trips.

**Squadron Transit Example:**

A jump tender with a 50,000-ton squadron transit rating leads a fleet with:
- Tender itself: 8,000 tons
- 4x Destroyers: 6,000 tons each (24,000 tons total)
- 2x Cruisers: 10,000 tons each (20,000 tons total)
- **Fleet total: 52,000 tons** (exceeds 50,000-ton limit)

The tender must make two trips: first carrying some ships through, then returning to escort the remainder. During this process, the fleet is temporarily split across two systems.

> **Tip:** "Jump tenders" -- ships designed primarily around a large military jump drive with minimal other equipment -- are a common fleet design. They allow your combat ships to forego jump drives entirely, dedicating that tonnage to weapons and armour instead. However, this creates a critical dependency: if the tender is destroyed, the fleet is stranded until another jump-capable ship arrives or a gate is built.

### Transit Effects

**Standard Transit (with Jump Drive):**

- Instant transit to the destination system
- Ship arrives at the corresponding jump point in the destination system
- No damage or negative effects under normal circumstances
- Jump drive enters a recharge period after transit (typically 12-24 hours depending on drive technology)
- All ships in a squadron transit arrive simultaneously

**Gate Transit (no Jump Drive required):**

- Instant transit, identical to jump drive transit
- No recharge period -- ships can transit again immediately
- Available to any ship regardless of tonnage or drive status
- Requires a gate on the side the ship is departing from

**Transit Delay (Jump Shock):**

After a jump drive transit, ships experience a brief period where their sensors and fire controls are recalibrating:

- Duration depends on crew grade and leadership bonuses
- During this window, the ship has reduced sensor effectiveness
- Tactical significance: a fleet arriving via jump drive at a defended jump point is temporarily vulnerable
- Gate transits do NOT incur transit delay

**Overloaded Transit:**

- If a ship attempts to transit with a drive too small for its tonnage, transit fails
- Squadron transit beyond drive capacity requires multiple trips
- The game will automatically calculate and execute multiple transits if ordered

### Jump Point Stabilization

Each jump point has two endpoints: one in each connected system. These endpoints can be stabilized independently by constructing jump gates:

- An unstabilized jump point can only be transited by ships with jump drives
- A stabilized endpoint (jump gate) allows any ship to transit from that side
- Stabilizing one side does NOT stabilize the other -- gates are one-way structures
- Both sides must be gated independently for unrestricted two-way transit
- See Section 4.4.3 for full jump gate construction details

**Stabilization States:**

| Your Side | Far Side | Who Can Transit (Your Side -> Far Side) | Who Can Transit (Far Side -> Your Side) |
|-----------|----------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| No Gate | No Gate | Jump-drive ships only | Jump-drive ships only |
| Gate | No Gate | Any ship | Jump-drive ships only |
| No Gate | Gate | Jump-drive ships only | Any ship |
| Gate | Gate | Any ship | Any ship |

### Blind Jumps

When a jump point has been detected but not yet transited, the first ship through performs a "blind jump":

- The destination system is unknown until the first transit
- There is no way to know what awaits on the other side
- Once transited, the connection is established and both endpoints become known
- Subsequent transits to that system are normal

> **Tip:** Always send a fast, expendable ship (or at least one you can afford to lose) on blind jumps into unknown systems. You never know if the other side contains a hostile alien fleet sitting on the jump point. A fast frigate with good sensors makes an ideal pathfinder.

## 4.4.3 Jump Gates

Jump gates are permanent structures built at jump point locations that stabilize the jump point, allowing any ship to transit without requiring a jump drive. They are the backbone of interstellar commerce and the foundation of a connected empire.

### Construction

**Requirements:**

- A specialized military vessel equipped with Jump Gate Construction Module(s) must be positioned at the jump point
- The construction process takes time based on the module's construction rate and technology level
- Jump gate construction ships are designed in the Ship Designer with the "Jump Gate Construction Module" component (see [Section 8.6 Other Components](../8-ship-design/8.6-other-components.md))

**Construction Process:**
1. Design and build a ship with one or more Jump Gate Construction Modules.
2. Move the construction ship to the jump point where you want to build a gate.
3. Issue the "Build Jump Gate" order from the fleet orders menu.
4. The ship remains stationary at the jump point during construction (it cannot move or perform other tasks).
5. Once complete, the jump gate is operational on that side of the jump point.
6. The construction ship is then free to move to the next jump point.

> **Tip:** Queue multiple "Build Jump Gate" orders for different jump points. The construction ship will complete one gate, then automatically move to the next jump point and begin construction there.

**Construction Time:**

- Base construction time depends on the technology level of your jump gate construction modules.
- Multiple construction modules on the same ship (or multiple ships at the same jump point) stack their construction rates, reducing build time.
- Typical construction times range from a few days (high-tech, multiple modules) to several months (starting tech, single module).
- The jump gate construction module component description shows its build rate in construction points per unit time.

**Construction Ship Design Tips:**

| Priority | Design Choice | Reasoning |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| High | Multiple construction modules | Faster gate completion |
| High | Jump drive (military) | Can reach ungated jump points independently |
| Medium | Good fuel range | Can operate far from refueling points |
| Medium | Moderate speed | Reduces transit time between jump points |
| Low | Armour/shields | Construction ships should not be in combat zones |

> **Warning:** Jump gate construction ships are specialized military vessels that consume shipyard capacity and mineral resources. They produce no direct combat value. Plan your construction ship builds carefully -- one well-designed constructor can gate an entire chain of systems, but building too many diverts resources from your combat fleet.

### Gate Properties

Once built, jump gates have the following characteristics:

- **Permanent:** Gates cannot be destroyed or dismantled (they are not physical objects that can be targeted in combat)
- **Instant Activation:** The gate is operational immediately upon construction completion
- **One-Way:** A gate only allows transit from the side it is built on; the far side must be gated separately
- **Universal Access:** Any ship can transit through a gate regardless of size, tonnage, or drive status
- **No Maintenance:** Gates require no crew, fuel, or upkeep after construction
- **No Transit Limit:** Any number of ships can transit a gate in the same time increment

### Benefits of Jump Gates

**Commercial Traffic:**

- Civilian shipping lines will only use gated jump points (they don't have jump drives; see [Section 14.1 Fuel](../14-logistics/14.1-fuel.md))
- Establishing gates opens trade routes for your civilian economy
- Colony supply ships and freighters can operate freely through gated systems

**Military Flexibility:**

- Warships without jump drives can transit gated jump points
- This allows smaller, more combat-focused designs without dedicating tonnage to jump drives
- Rapid reinforcement becomes possible through gated routes

**Fleet Logistics:**

- No recharge time needed when transiting through gates
- Ships can transit immediately upon reaching the jump point
- Multiple transits in quick succession are possible

### Strategic Considerations

**Gate Priority Framework:**

When deciding which jump points to gate first, consider the following priority order:

| Priority | Gate Target | Reason |
|----------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Home system connections | Enables civilian economy immediately |
| 2 | Resource-rich system routes | Allows freighter access to mines/colonies |
| 3 | Core network interior links | Builds robust trade network |
| 4 | Secondary colony connections | Expands civilian shipping reach |
| 5 | Frontier/border jump points | Only when area is secured |

**Defensive Value:**

- An ungated jump point acts as a natural bottleneck: only jump-capable ships can pass through
- Enemies must either gate the far side themselves (requiring construction ships in your space) or use only jump-drive-equipped vessels
- This limits hostile force composition -- they cannot send non-jump-capable ships through ungated points
- Station defenses at jump points are extremely effective since you know exactly where ships will arrive (see [Section 12.1 Fire Controls](../12-combat/12.1-fire-controls.md))
- Jump point defense bases (PDCs or orbital stations) can engage arriving ships during their transit delay window

**Jump Point Defence Strategies:**

1. **Layered Defence:** Station a defensive fleet at the jump point backed by orbital weapons platforms. Arriving enemies suffer transit delay while your forces engage at point-blank range.
2. **Picket Ships:** Station fast sensor ships at ungated border jump points to detect incoming threats and relay warnings. Even without combat capability, early warning is invaluable.
3. **Gate Denial:** Deliberately leave border jump points ungated to prevent mass invasion. The enemy must commit jump-capable ships only, limiting their force projection.
4. **Minefield:** Deploy mines around known jump point locations. Ships arriving via jump transit emerge directly into the minefield (see [Section 12.3 Missiles](../12-combat/12.3-missiles.md) for mine deployment).

> **Warning:** Defending a jump point means your fleet knows where the enemy will appear, but the enemy also knows where your fleet must be. A sufficiently powerful attacking force can overwhelm a static defense. Consider mobile reserves that can reinforce jump point garrisons.

**Gate Networks:**

- A fully gated network of systems allows maximum flexibility for fleet deployment and redeployment
- Commercial shipping thrives in gated networks, boosting civilian economy through expanded trade routes
- However, a fully gated border also means enemy fleets have easy access if they reach your gate network
- The ideal network has a gated interior for commerce and ungated frontier chokepoints for defence

**One-Way Gate Tactics:**

- Remember that each side of a jump point is gated independently
- You can gate your side (for easy departure) without gating the far side
- This creates asymmetric access: your ships can leave easily but returning requires a jump drive unless you also gate the return side
- Useful for forward-deploying fleets that have jump tenders for the return trip
- An enemy gating "their" side of a border jump point is a strong indicator of imminent invasion preparation

**Gating Strategy for Empire Expansion:**

The typical expansion pattern follows this sequence:

1. **Explore:** Send gravitational survey ships (with jump drives) to map new systems.
2. **Assess:** Determine which discovered systems have valuable resources or strategic position.
3. **Secure:** Deploy military assets to ensure the system is safe from hostiles.
4. **Gate Inward:** Build a gate on the new system's jump point facing back toward your core (allows easy retreat/reinforcement).
5. **Gate Outward:** Build a gate on the core system's jump point facing the new system (enables civilian access to the new system).
6. **Develop:** Once both sides are gated, civilian shipping and freighters can reach the system freely.

> **Tip:** A common early-game strategy is to gate the jump points between your core systems for commerce, but leave frontier jump points ungated. This forces potential enemies to bring jump-capable ships while your civilian economy benefits from the gated core. As you secure territory, expand the gate network outward. Keep in mind that your own warships will need jump drives or jump tenders to operate in ungated space.

> **Tip:** When you discover a system adjacent to a known hostile race, do NOT gate that jump point. The ungated connection forces the enemy to use only jump-capable vessels, severely limiting what they can throw at you. Meanwhile, prepare your defences at the jump point on your side.

## 4.4.4 Military Restricted Jump Points

Military Restricted Jump Points allow players to prevent civilian traffic from using specific jump point connections while maintaining broader system accessibility.

### Functionality

When a jump point receives the Military Restricted designation, it blocks civilian ships from entering either side of that connection. However, civilian vessels can still access the systems themselves through other routes -- the restriction applies only to the specific jump point, not the system as a whole.

### Configuration

The restriction is configured through the System View window, where affected jump points display an "(MR)" tag next to their destination indicator. When a player applies or removes this restriction at one end of a jump point, the change automatically applies to both sides of the connection simultaneously.

### Galactic Map Integration

The Galactic Map includes a display option to visualize all restricted connections, helping players strategically plan civilian trade routes and identify military-only corridors.

### Strategic Applications

- **Border Security:** Restrict jump points leading to contested or dangerous space while allowing civilian traffic through safer routes.
- **Trade Route Control:** Force civilian shipping through specific chokepoints where they can be more easily protected.
- **Military Corridors:** Designate jump points as military-only to prevent civilian ships from entering active combat zones.
- **Exploration Frontiers:** Keep civilian traffic away from newly discovered and unsecured jump points.

## 4.4.5 Regenerating Jump Points (Supervisor Mode)

In Supervisor Mode, the System View window includes a "Regen JP" button that allows players to regenerate all jump points in the currently selected system.

### Process

The regeneration function performs the following operations:

1. **Deletion:** Removes all existing jump points from the selected system.
2. **Breaking Links:** Severs any established connections between the selected system and other systems.
3. **Generation:** Creates a new set of jump points following standard generation procedures.
4. **Configuration:** A popup dialog allows the player to specify a minimum number of jump points for the regenerated system.

### Related SM Functions

The Supervisor Mode also provides complementary survey removal options:

- **"No Geo Survey"** removes geological survey data for the viewing race in the system.
- **"No Grav Survey"** removes gravitational survey data for the viewing race in the system.

> **Warning:** Regenerating jump points is a significant action that permanently changes system connectivity. Any gated jump points are lost, and previously established routes through the system will be broken. Use this feature carefully, particularly in systems that are part of established trade networks.
