# 4.4 Jump Points

## 4.4.1 Discovery

Jump points are the gateways between star systems in Aurora C#. They are fixed locations in space where the fabric of spacetime is thin enough to allow transit to another star system. Discovering jump points is essential for expanding beyond your home system.

### Gravitational Survey

Jump points are discovered through gravitational surveys conducted by ships equipped with gravitational survey sensors.

**Survey Process:**
1. Design and build a ship with gravitational survey sensors (found in the ship design component list).
2. Assign the ship to a fleet and set its orders to "Gravitational Survey" for the target system.
3. The ship will automatically navigate to different gravitational survey points within the system.
4. At each survey point, the sensor has a chance of detecting a jump point based on sensor strength and survey time.
5. Once all survey points have been checked, the system's gravitational survey is complete.

**Survey Point Mechanics:**
- Each system has a fixed number of gravitational survey points, determined during system generation.
- Survey points are distributed throughout the system at various distances from the star.
- The ship must physically travel to each point and spend time surveying.
- Larger gravitational survey sensors complete each point faster.

### Detection Probability

The chance of detecting a jump point at a survey point depends on:

- **Sensor Strength:** More powerful gravitational survey sensors have higher detection chances per increment of time.
- **Survey Time:** The longer a ship surveys a point, the higher the cumulative probability of detection. Eventually, a point is considered fully surveyed even if no jump point was found (because no jump point exists there).
- **Jump Point Size:** Larger jump points (those connecting to more massive star systems) are slightly easier to detect.

### Undiscovered Jump Points

It's important to note:
- A system may have jump points that your survey ships haven't found yet if the survey is incomplete.
- Hostile ships can arrive through jump points you haven't discovered, emerging from unknown connections.
- A complete gravitational survey of a system reveals all jump points present.
- Some systems may have no jump points at all beyond the one you entered through (dead ends).

### Survey Ship Design Tips

- **Speed vs. Sensor Size:** Faster survey ships complete surveys sooner because they spend less time in transit between survey points. Balance sensor size with engine power.
- **Range:** Ensure survey ships have enough fuel range to complete a system survey without refueling, especially for larger systems.
- **Multiple Ships:** Assigning multiple survey ships to the same system speeds up the survey, as they will divide the survey points between them.
- **Jump Capability:** Survey ships should either have jump drives or be accompanied by a jump-capable escort to reach new systems.

> **Tip:** Design your gravitational survey ships early in the game. A fast survey ship with a reasonably sized gravitational sensor and long fuel range will serve you throughout the early and mid-game. The faster you map jump point connections, the sooner you can identify resource-rich systems and potential threats.

## 4.4.2 Transit Mechanics

Transiting a jump point moves a ship (or fleet) instantaneously from one star system to another. However, several mechanics govern how jump transit works.

### Jump Drive Requirements

To transit a jump point without a jump gate, a ship requires a jump drive:

- **Military Jump Drives:** Standard jump drives that allow the equipped ship (and potentially its squadron) to transit. They have a maximum ship size they can move and a squadron transit capability.
- **Commercial Jump Drives:** Larger but less efficient drives designed for commercial vessels. They allow bigger ships to jump but are heavier relative to military drives.
- **Jump Drive Size:** The jump drive must be rated for at least the tonnage of the ship it's installed on. A ship with an undersized jump drive cannot transit.

### Squadron Transit

A ship with a jump drive can bring other ships through a jump point with it, using squadron transit:

- **Maximum Squadron Size:** Each jump drive has a maximum tonnage it can move through the jump point in a single transit. This includes the drive ship itself.
- **Formation:** Ships using squadron transit must be in the same fleet as the jump-capable ship.
- **Timing:** All ships transit simultaneously in a squadron jump.
- **Limitations:** If the total fleet tonnage exceeds the jump drive's squadron transit capacity, multiple jumps are required, with the jump-capable ship making round trips.

### Transit Effects

**Standard Transit (with Jump Drive):**
- Instant transit to the destination system
- Ship arrives at the corresponding jump point in the destination system
- No damage or negative effects under normal circumstances
- Jump drive enters a recharge period after transit (typically 12-24 hours depending on drive technology)

**Overloaded Transit:**
- If a ship attempts to transit with a drive too small for its tonnage, transit fails
- Squadron transit beyond drive capacity requires multiple trips

### Jump Point Stabilization

Each jump point has two endpoints: one in each connected system. These endpoints can be stabilized independently:

- An unstabilized jump point can only be transited by ships with jump drives
- A stabilized endpoint (jump gate) allows any ship to transit from that side
- Stabilizing one side does not stabilize the other; both sides must be gated for free two-way transit
- See section 4.4.3 for jump gate construction details

### Blind Jumps

When a jump point has been detected but not yet transited, the first ship through performs a "blind jump":

- The destination system is unknown until the first transit
- There is no way to know what awaits on the other side
- Once transited, the connection is established and both endpoints become known
- Subsequent transits to that system are normal

> **Tip:** Always send a fast, expendable ship (or at least one you can afford to lose) on blind jumps into unknown systems. You never know if the other side contains a hostile alien fleet sitting on the jump point. A fast frigate with good sensors makes an ideal pathfinder.

## 4.4.3 Jump Gates

Jump gates are permanent structures built at jump point locations that stabilize the jump point, allowing any ship to transit without requiring a jump drive.

### Construction

**Requirements:**
- A ship or fleet with a jump gate construction module must be positioned at the jump point
- The construction process takes time based on the module's construction rate
- Jump gate construction ships are designed in the ship designer with the "Jump Gate Construction Module" component

**Construction Process:**
1. Design and build a ship with one or more Jump Gate Construction Modules.
2. Move the construction ship to the jump point where you want to build a gate.
3. Issue the "Build Jump Gate" order.
4. The ship remains stationary at the jump point during construction.
5. Once complete, the jump gate is operational on that side of the jump point.

**Construction Time:**
- Base construction time depends on the technology level of your jump gate construction modules.
- Multiple construction modules on the same ship (or multiple ships at the same jump point) speed up construction.
- Typical construction times range from weeks to months depending on technology.

### Benefits of Jump Gates

**Commercial Traffic:**
- Civilian shipping lines will only use gated jump points (they don't have jump drives)
- Establishing gates opens trade routes for your civilian economy
- Colony supply ships and freighters can operate freely through gated systems

**Military Flexibility:**
- Warships without jump drives can transit gated jump points
- This allows smaller, more combat-focused designs without dedicating tonnage to jump drives
- Rapid reinforcement becomes possible through gated routes

**Fleet Logistics:**
- No recharge time needed when transiting through gates
- Ships can transit immediately upon reaching the jump point
- Multiple transits in quick succession are possible

### Strategic Considerations

**Gate Priorities:**
- Gate jump points on your main trade routes first to enable civilian commerce
- Gate jump points leading to resource-rich systems to allow freighter access
- Consider NOT gating jump points on your borders to create defensive chokepoints (ungated points require jump drives, limiting what enemies can send through)

**Defensive Value:**
- An ungated jump point acts as a natural bottleneck: only jump-capable ships can pass through
- Enemies must either gate the far side themselves (requiring construction ships) or use only jump-drive-equipped vessels
- Station defenses at jump points are extremely effective since you know exactly where ships will arrive

**Gate Networks:**
- A fully gated network of systems allows maximum flexibility for fleet deployment
- Commercial shipping thrives in gated networks, boosting civilian economy
- However, a fully gated border also means enemy fleets have easy access

**One-Way Gates:**
- Remember that each side of a jump point is gated independently
- You can gate your side (for easy departure) without gating the far side
- This creates asymmetric access: your ships can leave easily but returning requires a jump drive unless you also gate the return side

> **Tip:** A common early-game strategy is to gate the jump points between your core systems for commerce, but leave frontier jump points ungated. This forces potential enemies to bring jump-capable ships while your civilian economy benefits from the gated core. As you secure territory, expand the gate network outward. Keep in mind that your own warships will need jump drives or jump tenders to operate in ungated space.
