# 17.3 Xenoarchaeology

## 17.3.1 Ruins Discovery

Xenoarchaeology in Aurora C# deals with the discovery and excavation of ancient alien ruins left behind by extinct civilizations. These ruins can contain invaluable technological artifacts that dramatically accelerate your research or provide unique capabilities.

### How Ruins Are Generated

Alien ruins are generated during galaxy creation as part of the game setup:

- **Random Placement**: Ruins are placed on random bodies throughout the galaxy. Any planet, moon, or large asteroid can potentially host ruins.
- **Frequency Settings**: The game settings allow you to control how common ruins are. Higher settings create more ruin sites, providing more opportunities for discovery.
- **Tech Level Variation**: Ruins represent civilizations of varying technological advancement. Some contain only marginally useful artifacts, while others hold technologies far beyond your current capabilities.
- **Independent of NPRs**: Ruins are remnants of extinct civilizations, distinct from any living NPR races you may encounter. The builders are long dead.

### Discovering Ruins

Ruins are found through the geological survey process:

- When a geological survey of a body completes, any ruins present on that body are revealed alongside mineral deposits.
- An event message specifically notifies you of the ruins discovery, separate from mineral reports.
- The ruins appear in the body's information panel, showing that xenoarchaeological sites are present.

You cannot find ruins without conducting a geological survey. This means your survey ships serve double duty -- finding minerals and identifying ruin sites for later excavation.

### Ruins Characteristics

When ruins are discovered, the following information is revealed:

- **Presence**: You know ruins exist on the body, but not their full extent or contents until excavation begins.
- **Location**: The body where the ruins are located. This determines what infrastructure you need to exploit them.
- **Estimated Size**: A rough indication of how extensive the ruins are, which correlates with how many artifacts might be recovered.

### Where Ruins Are Commonly Found

While ruins can appear anywhere, some patterns tend to emerge:

- **Habitable Worlds**: More likely to host ruins, as the extinct civilization presumably needed habitable conditions.
- **Resource-Rich Bodies**: Bodies with good mineral deposits sometimes also have ruins, suggesting the builders valued the same resources.
- **System Cores**: Inner system bodies (closer to the star) are slightly more common ruin sites than distant outer system bodies.
- **Any Body Type**: Moons, asteroids, and planets can all host ruins. Do not neglect small bodies in your survey efforts.

**Tip**: When you discover ruins, evaluate how urgently you need the potential technology boost versus the cost of establishing an excavation operation. Early-game ruins near your homeworld are extremely valuable and worth immediate investment. Ruins discovered in distant, hostile systems may need to wait until you can secure the area.

## 17.3.2 Excavation

Once ruins are discovered, exploiting them requires dedicated xenoarchaeology teams and a sustained excavation effort. This is not a quick process -- excavation takes significant time and resources.

### Xenoarchaeology Teams

The primary requirement for excavation is Xenoarchaeology Teams (also called Xeno Teams). These are specialized ground installations:

- **Construction**: Xeno teams are built at your colonies like any other installation, requiring minerals and construction capacity.
- **Transport**: Once built, teams must be transported to the body where ruins are located. This requires colony ships or freighters capable of carrying installations.
- **Deployment**: Teams are deployed on the body surface like any other installation. They begin excavation automatically once in place.
- **Quantity Matters**: More teams excavating the same ruin site produce faster results. Each team works independently, and their output is additive.

### Excavation Process

The excavation process works as follows:

1. **Deploy Teams**: Transport xenoarchaeology teams to the body with ruins and deploy them on the surface.
2. **Automatic Excavation**: Teams automatically begin working on the ruins. No additional orders are required.
3. **Recovery Rolls**: Periodically, each team has a chance to recover an artifact or piece of technology. The rate depends on the number of teams and the richness of the site.
4. **Artifact Recovery**: When a recovery is successful, you receive a notification indicating what was found (see Section 17.3.3).
5. **Site Depletion**: Ruins are not infinite. Over time, the site is gradually exhausted as artifacts are recovered. Eventually, the ruins yield no more discoveries.

### Recovery Rate

The rate at which artifacts are recovered depends on several factors:

- **Number of Teams**: More teams means more chances per time period. Deploying 10 teams produces results roughly 10 times faster than a single team.
- **Ruin Richness**: Larger, more extensive ruins have more to find and yield discoveries more frequently.
- **Technology Level of Ruins**: Higher-tech ruins may be harder to excavate (the artifacts are more complex) but yield more valuable discoveries.
- **Random Chance**: Recovery has a stochastic element. Sometimes teams go long periods without finding anything, then discover multiple artifacts in quick succession.

### Establishing Excavation Colonies

For many ruin sites, you will need to establish a colony on the body:

- **Habitable Bodies**: If the ruins are on a habitable world, simply land colonists and xeno teams together. The colony supports the excavation naturally.
- **Inhospitable Bodies**: If the ruins are on an airless moon, a hostile-atmosphere planet, or an asteroid, you need an infrastructure colony. This requires:
  - Colony cost infrastructure to support population.
  - Life support installations if the environment is hostile.
  - Sufficient population to operate the xeno teams.
  - Supply routes to keep the colony operational.

### Managing Excavation Operations

Best practices for xenoarchaeology:

- **Concentrate Teams**: It is generally better to focus many teams on one site rather than spreading single teams across many sites. Concentrated effort produces results faster.
- **Rotate Sites**: Once a site is depleted, redeploy teams to the next known ruin location.
- **Maintain Supply**: Distant excavation colonies need regular supply shipments. Do not forget them.
- **Patience**: Excavation is a long-term investment. Months or years may pass between significant discoveries. Do not give up or abandon sites prematurely.

**Tip**: The transport cost of getting xeno teams to a distant ruin site is a one-time investment that can pay dividends for decades. Even if a site only yields one or two major discoveries, those technologies can advance your empire by years of research equivalent. Always excavate known ruins when feasible.

## 17.3.3 Recovered Technology

The real payoff of xenoarchaeology is the technology recovered from ruins. These discoveries can range from minor curiosities to game-changing breakthroughs that vault your empire ahead of its rivals.

### Types of Discoveries

Excavation can yield several categories of finds:

#### Technology Components
The most common and valuable finds are individual technology items:

- **Weapons Technology**: Beam weapons, missile warheads, kinetic weapons, or fire control systems more advanced than your current capabilities.
- **Propulsion Technology**: Engine designs, fuel efficiency improvements, or exotic propulsion systems.
- **Defensive Technology**: Armor compounds, shield generators, or ECM systems.
- **Sensor Technology**: Advanced sensors, fire control systems, or communication equipment.
- **Power Technology**: Reactor designs, power plant improvements, or energy storage systems.
- **Construction Technology**: Manufacturing techniques, hull materials, or shipyard improvements.

Each technology component recovered grants you the knowledge of that specific technology as if you had researched it yourself. This can save years of research time, particularly if the technology is far ahead of your current level.

#### Research Points
Some finds do not grant complete technologies but instead provide research point bonuses:

- **Partial Knowledge**: Incomplete artifacts that provide insight but not full understanding. These add research points toward a specific technology, accelerating (but not completing) your research.
- **General Knowledge**: Broad scientific data that can be applied to various research fields. Less focused but still valuable.

#### Installation Finds
Occasionally, excavation uncovers functional alien installations or equipment:

- **Alien Factories**: Manufacturing facilities that can be repurposed for your use.
- **Research Facilities**: Alien labs that provide research point generation.
- **Ground Forces**: Rarely, dormant alien military equipment that can be activated as ground combat units.

### Technology Integration

When you recover a technology from ruins:

- **Immediate Availability**: The technology is immediately available for use in ship designs, ground installations, or whatever context it applies to.
- **Prerequisite Bypass**: Recovered technology can bypass normal research prerequisites. You might obtain an advanced sensor without having researched intermediate sensor technologies.
- **No Ongoing Cost**: Once recovered, the technology requires no further investment. It is yours permanently.
- **Design Updates**: You may need to create new ship designs to take advantage of recovered technologies, as existing designs use older components.

### Value Assessment

Not all recovered technologies are equally useful:

- **Ahead of Current Level**: Technologies significantly ahead of your current research are the most valuable, as they save the most research time.
- **Behind Current Level**: Technologies you have already researched or surpassed are worthless beyond historical interest.
- **Niche Technologies**: Some recovered tech may be for systems you do not use or in fields you have not prioritized. These are still valuable as they expand your options.
- **Synergy**: A recovered engine technology is most valuable if you are also advancing in related fields like fuel efficiency and reactor technology. Isolated advances are useful but less transformative.

### Strategic Implications of Recovered Technology

Technology recovery from ruins has significant strategic implications:

- **Asymmetric Advantage**: Early ruin exploitation can give you technologies that NPRs have not yet developed, creating a temporary but exploitable military advantage.
- **Research Redirection**: If ruins provide technologies in one field, you can redirect your own research effort to other fields, developing a broader tech base faster.
- **Leapfrogging**: In rare cases, recovering a very advanced technology can allow you to skip entire generations of intermediate research, jumping directly to capabilities that would normally take decades to develop.
- **Competition**: If NPRs also have access to ruins in their territory, they may be recovering technologies as well. You are not the only civilization that can benefit from ancient knowledge.

### Maximizing Ruin Value

To get the most from xenoarchaeology:

1. **Prioritize Ruins in Useful Fields**: If you know (from the ruin's estimated tech level) that the ruins are likely to contain advanced propulsion technology, and propulsion is your weakest area, that site is extremely high priority.
2. **Excavate Early**: The earlier you recover advanced technology, the longer you benefit from the advantage it provides. A technology recovered in year 20 gives you 80 years of use by year 100. The same technology recovered in year 90 gives you only 10 years of advantage.
3. **Multiple Sites**: If you have access to multiple ruin sites, excavate all of them. Different sites contain different technologies, and each discovery compounds your advantage.
4. **Protect Ruin Sites**: If ruins are in contested or vulnerable territory, defend them. Losing a ruin site to an alien race means they benefit from the technology instead of you.

**Tip**: When you recover a technology significantly ahead of your current level, immediately review your ship designs and research priorities. That advanced beam weapon technology is useless if you never build ships that mount it. Similarly, if ruins give you advanced sensors, consider redirecting your sensor research budget to other fields where you are still behind. The goal is not just to recover technology but to integrate it into your strategic capabilities as quickly as possible.
