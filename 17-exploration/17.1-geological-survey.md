# 17.1 Geological Survey

## 17.1.1 Survey Mechanics

Geological surveys are the process by which your empire discovers mineral deposits on planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. Without a geological survey, you have no knowledge of what resources a body contains, making surveys one of the first and most important activities in any Aurora campaign.

### Survey Points

Each celestial body requires a certain number of survey points to complete its geological survey. The number of points required depends on the body's size:

- **Large Planets** (gas giants, super-earths): Require the most survey points, often 500+ due to their immense size and number of potential mining sites.
- **Terrestrial Planets**: Require moderate survey points (typically 200-400), proportional to their surface area.
- **Moons**: Require fewer points than planets (typically 50-200), depending on size.
- **Dwarf Planets**: Similar to large moons (100-200 points).
- **Asteroids**: Require the fewest points (typically 10-50), as they are small bodies.
- **Comets**: Similar to asteroids in survey requirements.

Survey points are generated by geological survey sensors aboard your survey ships. The ship must be in the same system as the target body and ordered to survey it.

### Survey Progress

Surveying is not instantaneous -- it takes time to accumulate the required survey points:

- Each geological survey sensor generates a fixed number of survey points per time increment based on the sensor's Survey Per Day rating.
- Multiple sensors on the same ship are additive, generating points faster.
- Multiple ships surveying the same body simultaneously each contribute their own points.
- Progress is tracked per-body and persists even if the survey ship leaves and returns later.

When the required number of survey points is reached, the survey completes and all mineral deposits on that body are revealed.

### Survey Orders

To conduct a geological survey, assign your survey ship a survey order through the Task Group Orders window:

1. Select the task group containing your survey ship.
2. Choose "Geological Survey" from the order list.
3. Select the target -- you can survey a specific body or set the ship to automatically survey all unsurveyed bodies in the system.

The most common approach is to use the "Survey All" order, which instructs the ship to automatically move to and survey each unsurveyed body in the system. The ship will prioritize bodies in an efficient order based on its current position and the relative positions of unsurveyed bodies.

### Survey Completion

When a geological survey of a body completes:

- All mineral deposits are revealed, showing the mineral type, quantity (in tons), and accessibility rating.
- An event message notifies you of the survey completion and any significant deposits found.
- The body is marked as "Geo Surveyed" in the system view.
- The survey ship automatically moves to the next unsurveyed body if using "Survey All" orders.

**Tip**: In systems with many bodies, a single survey ship can take years to complete all surveys. Consider sending multiple survey ships to large systems, or prioritizing habitable worlds and bodies near potential colony sites first. You can always come back for the asteroids later.

## 17.1.2 Survey Ships

Effective geological survey requires purpose-built ships equipped with the appropriate sensor components.

### Required Components

A geological survey ship must include at least one Geological Survey Sensor in its design. This is the only mandatory component for the survey function. However, practical survey ships also include:

- **Engine**: Obviously required for movement. Survey ships benefit from high speed to minimize transit time between survey targets.
- **Fuel Tanks**: Sufficient fuel capacity for extended operations across entire star systems without refueling.
- **Engineering Spaces**: For maintenance during long deployments away from port.
- **Life Support**: Extended life support for long-duration missions.

### Geological Survey Sensors

The Geological Survey Sensor is a specialized sensor component that generates survey points:

- **Base Model**: The starting sensor provides a set number of survey points per day. This rate improves with technology.
- **Higher Tech Versions**: As you research improved survey sensor technology, new sensors become available that generate more survey points per day, surveying bodies faster.
- **Multiple Sensors**: You can mount multiple geological survey sensors on a single ship for faster surveying. Each sensor independently contributes to the survey rate.
- **Size**: Survey sensors are relatively compact and do not require excessive hull space.

### Survey Speed Calculation

The time to survey a body is straightforward:

**Time = Survey Points Required / Total Survey Points Per Day**

For example, a planet requiring 300 survey points with a ship generating 30 points per day will take 10 days to survey. A ship with three sensors generating 30 points each (90 total) would complete the same survey in roughly 3.3 days.

### Optimal Survey Ship Design

When designing geological survey ships, consider:

- **Speed vs. Survey Rate**: A faster ship reaches targets sooner, but more sensors survey them faster. The optimal balance depends on system size and body density. In compact systems with many bodies close together, more sensors are better. In sparse systems with widely separated bodies, speed matters more.
- **Range**: Survey ships often operate far from refueling facilities. Ensure enough fuel capacity for at least one full system survey without refueling.
- **Endurance**: Survey missions can take months or years. Include sufficient maintenance supplies to avoid breakdowns.
- **Size**: Smaller ships are cheaper and faster to build. Since survey ships do not fight, there is no need for weapons or heavy armor. Keep them lean.
- **Jump Capability**: Consider whether your survey ships need their own jump drives or will rely on jump-capable escorts or jump gates. Ships with their own drives are more flexible but larger and more expensive.

### Example Survey Ship Designs

**Early Game Scout** (small, cheap, slow survey):
- 1x Geological Survey Sensor
- Small engine, large fuel tanks
- Minimal crew, extended life support
- Approximately 1,000-2,000 tons

**Mid-Game Surveyor** (balanced speed and capability):
- 2-3x Geological Survey Sensors
- Medium engine for good transit speed
- Adequate fuel for extended operations
- Jump drive for independent operation
- Approximately 3,000-5,000 tons

**Late Game Survey Cruiser** (fast, efficient, durable):
- 4-6x Geological Survey Sensors (advanced technology)
- High-performance engines
- Extended range fuel tanks
- Full maintenance facilities
- Jump drive
- Optional: point defense for hostile space operations
- Approximately 6,000-10,000 tons

**Tip**: Survey ships are among the first ships your empire will build and remain useful throughout the entire game. Design a good one early and keep building improved versions as your technology advances. Having three or four survey ships exploring simultaneously is far more efficient than relying on a single vessel.

## 17.1.3 Mineral Discovery

The ultimate purpose of geological surveys is discovering exploitable mineral deposits. Understanding how minerals are distributed and what the survey results mean is crucial for planning your empire's economy.

### Mineral Types

Aurora C# features eleven minerals, each essential for different aspects of construction and technology:

| Mineral | Primary Uses |
|---|---|
| Duranium | Hull construction, basic structures |
| Neutronium | Armor, heavy structural components |
| Corbomite | Advanced armor, shields |
| Tritanium | Electronic components, sensors |
| Boronide | Power plants, reactors |
| Mercassium | Research equipment, electronics |
| Vendarite | Weapons systems |
| Sorium | Fuel (refined into fuel for ships) |
| Uridium | Jump drives, advanced components |
| Corundium | Terraforming equipment, life support |
| Gallicite | Engines, propulsion systems |

### Deposit Characteristics

Each mineral deposit discovered through geological survey has two key attributes:

#### Quantity
The total amount of the mineral available, measured in tons. Deposits range from tiny (a few hundred tons) to massive (millions of tons). Larger deposits sustain mining operations longer before depletion.

#### Accessibility

Accessibility is rated from 0.1 to 1.0 and determines the effective mining rate:

- **1.0 (Maximum)**: The deposit is on the surface or easily accessible. Mining produces at full efficiency.
- **0.5 (Moderate)**: The deposit requires some effort to reach. Mining produces at half the normal rate.
- **0.1 (Minimum)**: The deposit is deep underground or otherwise difficult to exploit. Mining produces at only 10% of the normal rate.

Accessibility directly multiplies mining output. A deposit with 1,000,000 tons at 0.3 accessibility effectively produces minerals at 30% of the normal mining rate, making it equivalent to a 300,000-ton deposit at 1.0 accessibility for output purposes (though the total quantity available is still 1,000,000 tons).

### Accessibility Changes

As a deposit is mined, its accessibility gradually decreases. The easiest-to-reach portions of the deposit are extracted first, leaving progressively harder-to-access material. This means mining output from any single deposit naturally declines over time, eventually making the deposit uneconomical to exploit compared to finding new, more accessible sources.

### Evaluating Survey Results

When reviewing survey results for a newly surveyed body, consider:

- **Total Mineral Value**: The combined quantity and accessibility of all minerals present. A body with large, accessible deposits of multiple minerals is a prime mining candidate.
- **Critical Minerals**: Some minerals are chronically scarce (Gallicite and Sorium are common bottlenecks). Prioritize bodies with good deposits of your scarcest minerals.
- **Accessibility**: A small deposit at 1.0 accessibility may be more immediately valuable than a huge deposit at 0.1.
- **Location**: A moderate deposit in a convenient location (near existing colonies or jump points) may be more practical than an excellent deposit in a dangerous or distant system.

### Bodies Without Minerals

Not every surveyed body will have useful mineral deposits. Many asteroids, moons, and even planets will be mineral-poor or entirely barren. This is normal and expected. Typically:

- Gas giants rarely have accessible minerals (but their moons may).
- Terrestrial planets in habitable zones often have moderate deposits.
- Asteroids are hit-or-miss -- many are worthless, but some are mineral-rich.
- Comets occasionally have small but accessible deposits, particularly of Sorium.

### Survey Strategy for Minerals

To maximize the return on your survey investment:

1. **Survey habitable worlds first**: They are candidates for colonization regardless of minerals, and mineral deposits are a bonus.
2. **Survey inner system bodies next**: Closer to your likely colonies, easier to exploit.
3. **Survey asteroid belts**: High-accessibility deposits are common in asteroids, though quantities tend to be smaller.
4. **Leave distant/peripheral bodies for later**: Survey them when your nearer resources are depleted or when convenient.

**Tip**: Do not dismiss low-accessibility deposits entirely. As your technology improves and you gain access to more efficient mining operations, deposits that were uneconomical early in the game become viable later. A body with massive quantities at 0.2 accessibility might be worth colonizing once you have advanced mining technology and have exhausted more accessible deposits elsewhere.
