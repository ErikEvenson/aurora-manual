# 5.2 Population

## 5.2.1 Growth Rate

Population growth is a fundamental mechanic in Aurora C# that drives your empire's expansion potential. More population means more workers for industry, more scientists for research, and more manpower for your military.

### Base Growth Rate

Population grows at a base annual rate that can be modified by several factors:

- **Default Growth Rate:** The base annual growth rate is set during game creation (typically 1-2% per year for a standard game).
- **Calculation:** Growth is applied to the total population each year. A colony of 100 million with 2% growth adds 2 million per year.
- **Compound Growth:** Like interest, population growth compounds. A 2% growth rate doubles population in approximately 35 years.

### Factors Affecting Growth

**Positive Modifiers:**
- **Adequate Infrastructure:** When infrastructure meets or exceeds the colony's needs, population grows at full rate.
- **Sector Governor Bonus:** Governors with population growth bonuses increase the rate for their assigned colony.
- **Low Overcrowding:** When a colony is well below its carrying capacity, growth proceeds normally.

**Negative Modifiers:**
- **Insufficient Infrastructure:** If infrastructure is below the required level for the current population and colony cost, growth is reduced. Severe shortfalls can cause population decline (deaths from life support failure).
- **Overcrowding:** When population exceeds the colony's comfortable capacity, growth slows.
- **Environmental Damage:** Radiation, extreme temperatures without adequate infrastructure, or toxic atmosphere breaches slow growth.
- **Lack of Employment:** Extreme unemployment can reduce growth rates as economic conditions deteriorate.

### Population Decline

Population can decrease in several situations:

- **Infrastructure Failure:** If infrastructure drops below critical levels (due to maintenance failure, enemy bombardment, or transportation issues), population will die.
- **Orbital Bombardment:** Enemy attacks on a colony directly kill population.
- **Environmental Catastrophe:** Loss of atmosphere containment on hostile worlds.
- **Emigration:** Population may leave a colony for better opportunities elsewhere (primarily a civilian economy mechanic).

### Managing Growth Strategically

- **Early Game:** Growth is your most precious resource. Protect your homeworld population and resist sending too many colonists away at once.
- **Mid Game:** Once your homeworld exceeds 1-2 billion, you can afford to seed new colonies more aggressively.
- **Late Game:** With multiple established colonies, compound growth across your empire generates enormous population increases each year.

> **Tip:** In the early game, every million colonists you send to a new colony is a million fewer growing at your homeworld. Consider waiting until your homeworld reaches a comfortable population before aggressively colonizing. A homeworld with 500 million people growing at 2% generates 10 million new colonists per year -- enough to seed new colonies without stunting homeworld growth.

## 5.2.2 Population Capacity

Every colony has a maximum population it can reasonably support, determined by the world's characteristics and the infrastructure available.

### Carrying Capacity

**On Ideal Worlds (Colony Cost 0.00):**
- No theoretical population cap from infrastructure
- Practical limits come from available employment and living space
- The world can support as many people as you can transport there

**On Non-Ideal Worlds (Colony Cost > 0.00):**
- Population capacity is determined by available infrastructure
- Formula: Maximum Supported Population = Infrastructure / (Colony Cost x 100) (in millions)
- Exceeding this capacity causes population losses due to inadequate life support

### Infrastructure as a Limiting Factor

Infrastructure is the primary cap on population for most colonies:

- Each unit of infrastructure supports a fixed number of colonists based on colony cost
- Building more infrastructure raises the population cap
- Infrastructure can be built locally (using construction factories) or transported from elsewhere
- Infrastructure requires maintenance -- without maintenance facilities or supply, it degrades over time

### Practical Population Limits

Beyond infrastructure, practical considerations limit how large a colony should grow:

**Employment:** Population needs jobs. Unemployed population still consumes resources but produces nothing. Key employment sources:
- Mining installations
- Construction factories
- Research labs
- Naval shipyards
- Ground force training facilities
- Maintenance facilities
- Various other installations

**Resource Consumption:** Larger populations consume more fuel for heating/cooling (on non-ideal worlds) and place greater demands on the logistics network.

**Diminishing Returns:** At very large population levels, the administrative overhead of maintaining the colony can outweigh the benefits of additional growth.

### Balancing Population Across Colonies

A common challenge is balancing population distribution across your empire:

- Your homeworld typically has the most people and highest production
- New colonies need population to function but shouldn't drain the homeworld excessively
- Specialized colonies (mining, fuel production) may need relatively small populations
- Industrial colonies benefit from large populations to staff construction factories

> **Tip:** A useful rule of thumb: aim for population to match employment. If a colony has 50 mines and 20 construction factories, it needs roughly 3.5 million people to fully staff them. Sending more population than can be employed wastes colonist transport capacity.

## 5.2.3 Labor and Employment

Population in Aurora C# is not just a number -- it represents the workforce that operates your installations, staffs your shipyards, and drives your industrial output.

### How Employment Works

Each installation type requires a certain amount of population to operate at full capacity:

- **Mines:** Each mine employs approximately 50,000 workers (0.05 million)
- **Automated Mines:** No workers required (that's the point)
- **Construction Factories:** Each factory employs approximately 50,000 workers
- **Research Labs:** Each lab employs approximately 50,000 workers
- **Naval Shipyards:** Larger employment per yard, varies by yard size
- **Fuel Refineries:** Each refinery employs approximately 50,000 workers
- **Maintenance Facilities:** Each facility employs approximately 50,000 workers
- **Ground Force Training Facilities:** Employment varies by facility size
- **Mass Drivers:** Minimal employment per installation
- **Financial Centers:** Each center employs approximately 50,000 workers
- **Terraforming Installations:** Each installation employs approximately 50,000 workers

### Production and Population

An installation's output is directly tied to whether it has sufficient workers:

- **Fully Staffed:** Installation operates at 100% efficiency
- **Partially Staffed:** If the colony's population is insufficient to staff all installations, each installation operates at reduced efficiency proportional to available workforce
- **Overstaffed:** Having more population than installations require does not boost production beyond 100% -- the excess population is simply unemployed

### Unemployment Effects

High unemployment can have negative effects on a colony:

- Reduced political stability
- Slower population growth
- No direct production benefit from unemployed workers
- Consider building additional installations or relocating excess population

### Workforce Allocation Priority

When a colony doesn't have enough population to staff all installations, Aurora prioritizes allocation. Generally:

1. Life-critical installations first
2. Military installations
3. Industrial installations
4. Others

You cannot manually set workforce priorities -- the game handles allocation automatically. If you want specific installations to be fully staffed, ensure your population meets or exceeds total employment requirements.

### Optimizing Production

To maximize a colony's output:

1. **Match Population to Installations:** Calculate total employment needed and ensure population meets it.
2. **Build Incrementally:** Add installations as population grows, rather than building 100 mines on a colony with 1 million people.
3. **Use Automation Where Appropriate:** Automated mines on low-population bodies save the logistical headache of colonist transport.
4. **Consider Governor Bonuses:** Governors with manufacturing or mining bonuses effectively increase per-installation output, getting more from the same workforce.

### Wealth and Economic Activity

Population also generates wealth through economic activity:

- **Financial Centers:** Convert population economic activity into wealth (money)
- **Wealth Uses:** Pays for ship maintenance, crew salaries, and other recurring costs
- **Tax Rate:** Adjustable to balance income vs. population satisfaction
- **Civilian Economy:** Larger populations support more robust civilian shipping and industry

> **Tip:** A common mistake is building installations faster than population can staff them. Each unstaffed installation is wasted construction effort that could have gone toward something useful. Track your employment ratio (total jobs vs. total population) and keep it roughly balanced. If you find yourself with hundreds of idle installations, stop building and start shipping colonists.
