# 5.2 Population

## 5.2.1 Growth Rate

Population growth is a fundamental mechanic in Aurora C# that drives your empire's expansion potential. More population means more workers for industry, more scientists for research, and more manpower for your military.

### Base Growth Rate

Population grows at a base annual rate that can be modified by several factors:

- **Default Growth Rate:** The base annual growth rate is set during game creation (typically 1-2% per year for a standard game).
- **Calculation:** Growth is applied to the total population each year. A colony of 100 million with 2% growth adds 2 million per year.
- **Compound Growth:** Like interest, population growth compounds. A 2% growth rate doubles population in approximately 35 years.

### Factors Affecting Growth

**Positive Modifiers:**
- **Adequate Infrastructure:** When infrastructure meets or exceeds the colony's needs, population grows at full rate.
- **Sector Governor Bonus:** Governors with population growth bonuses increase the rate for their assigned colony.
- **Low Overcrowding:** When a colony is well below its carrying capacity, growth proceeds normally.

**Negative Modifiers:**
- **Insufficient Infrastructure:** If infrastructure is below the required level for the current population and colony cost, growth is reduced. Severe shortfalls can cause population decline (deaths from life support failure).
- **Overcrowding:** When population exceeds the colony's comfortable capacity, growth slows.
- **Environmental Damage:** Radiation, extreme temperatures without adequate infrastructure, or toxic atmosphere breaches slow growth.
- **Lack of Employment:** Extreme unemployment can reduce growth rates as economic conditions deteriorate.

### Population Decline

Population can decrease in several situations:

- **Infrastructure Failure:** If infrastructure drops below critical levels (due to maintenance failure, enemy bombardment, or transportation issues), population will die.
- **Orbital Bombardment:** Enemy attacks on a colony directly kill population.
- **Environmental Catastrophe:** Loss of atmosphere containment on hostile worlds.
- **Emigration:** Population may leave a colony for better opportunities elsewhere (primarily a civilian economy mechanic).

### Managing Growth Strategically

- **Early Game:** Growth is your most precious resource. Protect your homeworld population and resist sending too many colonists away at once.
- **Mid Game:** Once your homeworld exceeds 1-2 billion, you can afford to seed new colonies more aggressively.
- **Late Game:** With multiple established colonies, compound growth across your empire generates enormous population increases each year.

> **Tip:** In the early game, every million colonists you send to a new colony is a million fewer growing at your homeworld. Consider waiting until your homeworld reaches a comfortable population before aggressively colonizing. A homeworld with 500 million people growing at 2% generates 10 million new colonists per year -- enough to seed new colonies without stunting homeworld growth.

## 5.2.2 Population Capacity

Every colony has a maximum population it can reasonably support, determined by the body's physical characteristics. Population capacity represents the maximum population that can be maintained on a single body and is determined primarily by surface area. This is the total of all populations on the same body, not per population (in multi-race games).

### Base Capacity Calculation

The foundational formula uses Earth as the reference point:

**Maximum Capacity = (Body Surface Area / Earth Surface Area) x 12 billion**

This baseline assumes an Earth-sized planet can sustain approximately 12 billion inhabitants.

### Growth Rate Interaction

Population grows normally up to 33% of maximum capacity. Beyond this threshold, growth declines linearly, reaching zero at maximum capacity. This mirrors real-world demographic trends where population growth rates peaked at approximately 2.1% when the world population was around 4 billion (one-third of estimated carrying capacity).

### Water Coverage Modifier

Once water coverage exceeds 75%, population capacity diminishes linearly:

- At 75% water coverage: full capacity
- At 100% water coverage: capacity drops to just 1% of normal (representing scattered islands or floating colonies)
- Below 75%: no reduction from water coverage

### Tide-Locked Worlds

Tide-locked planets receive only 20% of normal population capacity, reflecting that habitation is confined to the temperate band between the permanently lit and permanently dark hemispheres. As compensation, these worlds receive an 80% reduction in temperature-based colony costs.

### Species Variation

Each species has an adjustable population density modifier (baseline 1.0), allowing variance based on biology and culture. This modifier scales the base capacity calculation up or down.

### Minimum Threshold

Regardless of other calculations, any non-gas giant body with gravity at or below the species' maximum tolerance maintains a floor capacity of 50,000 inhabitants.

### Infrastructure as a Limiting Factor

On non-ideal worlds (colony cost > 0), infrastructure provides an additional population cap below the body's physical capacity:

- Formula: Maximum Supported Population = Infrastructure / (Colony Cost x 200) (in millions)
- Building more infrastructure raises this cap toward the body's physical limit
- Infrastructure can be built locally (using construction factories) or transported from elsewhere
- Exceeding infrastructure capacity causes population losses due to inadequate life support

### Practical Population Limits

Beyond physical capacity and infrastructure, practical considerations limit how large a colony should grow:

**Employment:** Population needs jobs. Unemployed population still consumes resources but produces nothing. Key employment sources:
- Mining installations
- Construction factories
- Research labs
- Naval shipyards
- Ground force training facilities
- Maintenance facilities
- Various other installations

**Resource Consumption:** Larger populations consume more fuel for heating/cooling (on non-ideal worlds) and place greater demands on the logistics network.

**Diminishing Returns:** At very large population levels, the administrative overhead of maintaining the colony can outweigh the benefits of additional growth.

### Balancing Population Across Colonies

A common challenge is balancing population distribution across your empire:

- Your homeworld typically has the most people and highest production
- New colonies need population to function but shouldn't drain the homeworld excessively
- Specialized colonies (mining, fuel production) may need relatively small populations
- Industrial colonies benefit from large populations to staff construction factories

> **Tip:** A useful rule of thumb: aim for population to match employment. If a colony has 50 mines and 20 construction factories, it needs roughly 3.5 million people to fully staff them. Sending more population than can be employed wastes colonist transport capacity.

## 5.2.3 Labor and Employment

Population in Aurora C# is not just a number -- it represents the workforce that operates your installations, staffs your shipyards, and drives your industrial output.

### How Employment Works

Each installation type requires a specific number of workers to operate at full capacity. Workers are only required where they would meaningfully impact gameplay -- automated or minimal-staffing installations are exempt.

**High Worker Demand (250,000 workers per installation):**
- Terraforming Installation
- Ground Force Construction Facility
- Genetic Modification Centre

**Medium Worker Demand (50,000 workers per installation):**
- Construction Factory
- Ordnance Factory
- Fighter Factory
- Fuel Refinery
- Mine
- Conventional Industry
- Maintenance Facility
- Financial Centre

**Low Worker Demand (5,000 workers per installation):**
- Forced Labour Construction Camp
- Forced Labour Mining Camp

**No Worker Requirements:**
- Infrastructure
- Deep Space Tracking Station
- Automated Mine
- Military Academy
- Sector Command
- Mass Driver
- Civilian Mining Complex
- Refuelling Station
- Naval Headquarters
- Ordnance Transfer Station
- Cargo Shuttle Station

**Naval Shipyard Workers:** Shipyard worker requirements are calculated separately based on shipyard size (250 workers per ton of shipyard capacity for naval shipyards).

### Manufacturing Sector and Service Sector

A colony's population is divided between the manufacturing sector and the service sector. The service sector cap in C# Aurora is 70% (reduced from 75% in VB6), meaning the manufacturing sector comprises at least 30% of the population. On a homeworld operating at maximum service sector, this means 30% of population is available for manufacturing work.

This change was made to accommodate the increased worker requirements for shipyards, financial centres, and maintenance facilities in C# Aurora.

### Production and Population

An installation's output is directly tied to whether it has sufficient workers:

- **Fully Staffed:** Installation operates at 100% efficiency
- **Partially Staffed:** If the colony's manufacturing population is insufficient to staff all installations, each installation operates at reduced efficiency proportional to available workforce
- **Overstaffed:** Having more manufacturing population than installations require does not boost production beyond 100% -- the excess population is simply unemployed

### Unemployment Effects

High unemployment can have negative effects on a colony:

- Reduced political stability
- Slower population growth
- No direct production benefit from unemployed workers
- Consider building additional installations or relocating excess population

### Workforce Allocation Priority

When a colony doesn't have enough population to staff all installations, Aurora prioritizes allocation. Generally:

1. Life-critical installations first
2. Military installations
3. Industrial installations
4. Others

You cannot manually set workforce priorities -- the game handles allocation automatically. If you want specific installations to be fully staffed, ensure your population meets or exceeds total employment requirements.

### Optimizing Production

To maximize a colony's output:

1. **Match Population to Installations:** Calculate total employment needed and ensure population meets it.
2. **Build Incrementally:** Add installations as population grows, rather than building 100 mines on a colony with 1 million people.
3. **Use Automation Where Appropriate:** Automated mines on low-population bodies save the logistical headache of colonist transport.
4. **Consider Governor Bonuses:** Governors with manufacturing or mining bonuses effectively increase per-installation output, getting more from the same workforce.

### Wealth and Economic Activity

In C# Aurora, wealth generation is tied to industrial output rather than total population. Each 1 million workers in TN installations produces a baseline of 100 wealth per annum, regardless of whether their assigned installation is actively building or producing.

- **Worker-Based Wealth:** Only workers assigned to TN installations generate wealth. Workers in Conventional Factories and Forced Labour Camps do not generate wealth.
- **Wealth Generation Technology:** A dedicated tech line increases wealth output, starting at 120 wealth per million workers (3,000 RP), then 140 (5,000 RP), and continuing upward.
- **Financial Centres:** Generate supplementary wealth equal to the tax from 250,000 workers. Unlike VB6, financial centres can be transported between colonies.
- **Tax Rate:** Adjustable to balance income vs. population satisfaction.
- **Civilian Economy:** Larger populations support more robust civilian shipping and industry.

> **Tip:** A common mistake is building installations faster than population can staff them. Each unstaffed installation is wasted construction effort that could have gone toward something useful. Track your employment ratio (total jobs vs. total population) and keep it roughly balanced. If you find yourself with hundreds of idle installations, stop building and start shipping colonists.
