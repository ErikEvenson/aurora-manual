# 5.5 Terraforming

## 5.5.1 Terraforming Installations

Terraforming is the process of modifying a planet's atmosphere to make it more suitable for human habitation. In Aurora C#, this is accomplished through specialized terraforming installations that add or remove specific gases from the atmosphere.

### How Terraforming Installations Work

**Basic Mechanics:**
- Each terraforming installation processes a fixed amount of atmospheric gas per year
- Installations can either add gas to the atmosphere or remove gas from it
- Each installation is assigned to work on one specific gas at a time
- The rate of atmospheric change depends on the number of installations and the planet's surface area

**Installation Assignment:**
1. Build or transport terraforming installations to the target colony
2. Open the colony's Environment tab
3. Select the gas to add or remove from the dropdown
4. Assign the number of installations to that task
5. The installations begin processing immediately

**Rate of Change:**
- Base rate is determined by terraforming technology level
- Higher tech levels increase the gas volume processed per installation per year
- Smaller planets change faster (less atmosphere to modify)
- Larger planets require proportionally more installations for the same rate of change
- The rate is expressed in atm of partial pressure change per year per installation

### Technology Requirements

**Terraforming Technology Line:**
- Research in the Terraforming category unlocks improved installation efficiency
- Higher tech levels mean each installation processes more gas per year
- This is one of the most impactful long-term research investments

**Installation Construction:**
- Terraforming installations are built by construction factories like any other installation
- They require specific minerals (primarily Duranium and Boronide)
- Each installation employs approximately 50,000 workers
- They can be transported between colonies if priorities change

### Planetary Size Effects

The planet's size dramatically affects terraforming timelines:

- **Small Bodies (Mars-sized or smaller):** Atmosphere changes relatively quickly. A few dozen installations can make noticeable changes within years.
- **Earth-sized Worlds:** Moderate terraforming times. Typically requires 50-200 installations for decade-scale changes.
- **Super-Earths:** Very slow atmospheric modification due to massive atmospheric volumes. May require hundreds of installations and centuries of work.
- **Gas Giants:** Cannot be terraformed (no solid surface to terraform).

> **Tip:** When choosing terraforming targets, prefer smaller worlds. A Mars-sized body with colony cost 2.0 might be terraformed to 0.5 in 20-30 years with 50 installations, while an Earth-sized world with the same colony cost might take 50-100 years with the same investment. Factor planet size into your terraforming priority decisions.

## 5.5.2 Gas Addition and Removal

The core of terraforming is manipulating specific gases in the atmosphere. Understanding which gases to add or remove and in what order is critical for efficient terraforming.

### Gases You Can Add

**Oxygen (O2):**
- Required for breathable atmosphere (0.1-0.3 atm partial pressure)
- Usually one of the last gases added to avoid creating a toxic or flammable mix with existing gases
- Adding O2 to a methane-rich atmosphere creates an explosive hazard

**Nitrogen (N2):**
- The primary filler gas in a breathable atmosphere
- Inert and non-toxic within a wide pressure range (0.0-3.0 atm)
- Used to bring total atmospheric pressure up to breathable levels
- Safe to add in large quantities

**Carbon Dioxide (CO2):**
- Powerful greenhouse gas
- Adding CO2 raises surface temperature through greenhouse effect
- Useful for warming cold worlds
- Must be kept below toxic levels (0.0005 atm) for breathability
- Can be added to warm a planet, then removed once temperature is adequate

**Water Vapor (H2O):**
- Greenhouse gas that also contributes to hydrosphere development
- Adding water vapor raises temperature and may create surface water
- Important for long-term habitability

**Methane (CH4):**
- Very potent greenhouse gas (more effective per molecule than CO2)
- Useful for rapid warming of very cold worlds
- Toxic and must be removed before the atmosphere becomes breathable
- Often used as a temporary warming agent

### Gases You Can Remove

**Carbon Dioxide (CO2):**
- Remove to reduce greenhouse warming on too-hot worlds
- Remove to bring below toxic threshold for breathability
- Common first step on Venus-type worlds

**Methane (CH4):**
- Remove after using it for greenhouse warming
- Toxic and flammable -- must be absent for breathability
- Can be removed relatively quickly from thin atmospheres

**Toxic Gases (Cl2, F2, SO2, NO2, CO, H2S, NH3):**
- Must be completely removed for a breathable atmosphere
- Each type adds to colony cost while present
- Priority removal targets due to their direct impact on colony cost
- Some toxic gases are present in only trace amounts but still cause significant cost

**Excess Oxygen:**
- If O2 partial pressure exceeds 0.3 atm, it becomes toxic
- Remove excess oxygen to bring levels into the breathable range
- This can happen on worlds with natural oxygen-rich atmospheres

**Hydrogen (H2) and Helium (He):**
- Remove to reduce total atmospheric pressure
- These light gases contribute to pressure but serve no useful purpose for habitability
- Removing them can take a very long time on large worlds

### Terraforming Strategies by World Type

**Cold, Airless World (e.g., Mars-type):**
1. Add CO2 or CH4 for greenhouse warming
2. Wait for temperature to rise toward habitable range
3. Add N2 to build atmospheric pressure
4. Add O2 to breathable levels
5. Remove greenhouse gases (CH4) if temperature overshoots
6. Fine-tune gas levels for ideal breathability

**Hot, Dense Atmosphere (e.g., Venus-type):**
1. Remove CO2 to reduce greenhouse effect and cool the planet
2. Remove toxic gases if present
3. Continue removing CO2 until temperature drops to habitable range
4. This can take a very long time due to the massive atmospheric volume
5. Add N2 and O2 once pressure and temperature are manageable

**Cold World with Toxic Atmosphere:**
1. Remove toxic gases first (highest colony cost impact)
2. Add greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4) to warm the planet
3. Build pressure with N2 if needed
4. Add O2 last
5. Remove temporary greenhouse gases if temperature overshoots

**Near-Habitable World (minor adjustments needed):**
1. Identify the specific issue (slight temperature offset, trace toxins, pressure imbalance)
2. Make targeted adjustments to the specific problem gas
3. These worlds require the least investment and yield results fastest

> **Tip:** Always remove toxic gases before adding oxygen. An atmosphere with both oxygen and methane is explosive, and adding oxygen to a chlorine-rich atmosphere creates dangerous reactions. The general order should be: Remove toxics first, adjust temperature second, add breathable gases last.

## 5.5.3 Long-Term Planning

Terraforming in Aurora C# is a project measured in decades or centuries. Effective terraforming requires careful long-term planning, resource commitment, and realistic expectations.

### Realistic Timelines

**Quick Wins (5-20 years):**
- Removing trace toxic gases from an otherwise near-habitable world
- Minor temperature adjustments on small worlds
- Raising pressure slightly on thin-atmosphere worlds
- These reduce colony cost incrementally and provide early returns

**Medium Projects (20-100 years):**
- Fully terraforming a Mars-sized world from cold/airless to habitable
- Removing significant toxic gas concentrations from medium worlds
- Raising temperature 50-100C on cold worlds through greenhouse gases
- The typical "reasonable" terraforming project

**Long-Term Projects (100-500+ years):**
- Terraforming Earth-sized or larger worlds with major atmospheric issues
- Venus-type atmospheric removal (extremely dense, hot atmospheres)
- Complete atmospheric replacement on large worlds
- These are generational projects that span most of a game

**Impractical Projects:**
- Terraforming super-Earths with massive hostile atmospheres
- Worlds requiring gravity modification (impossible with terraforming)
- Worlds so far from their star that no practical greenhouse warming is sufficient

### Planning Your Terraforming Investment

**Step 1: Identify Targets**
- Survey all colonized and candidate worlds for colony cost breakdown
- Identify which colony cost components are from terraformable factors (temperature, atmosphere) vs. non-terraformable (gravity)
- Prioritize worlds where terraforming can make the biggest colony cost reduction

**Step 2: Calculate Requirements**
- Determine how much gas needs to be added or removed
- Factor in planet size (larger = more gas needed)
- Estimate timeline based on available installations and tech level
- Compare the investment cost vs. just building more infrastructure

**Step 3: Allocate Resources**
- Decide how many terraforming installations to build/deploy
- Balance terraforming against other construction priorities
- Consider that installations tied up in terraforming aren't available for other tasks
- Set realistic milestones (e.g., "reduce colony cost from 3.0 to 2.0 within 50 years")

**Step 4: Monitor and Adjust**
- Check atmospheric progress regularly
- Adjust gas targets as conditions change
- Watch for overshoot (too much greenhouse warming, too much oxygen, etc.)
- Reassign installations once goals are met

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**When Terraforming Is Worth It:**
- The world has excellent minerals or strategic value justifying long-term investment
- Colony cost reduction will save more infrastructure than the terraforming installations cost
- The planet is small enough for reasonable timelines
- You plan to maintain the colony for centuries

**When Terraforming Is NOT Worth It:**
- The primary colony cost factor is gravity (unchangeable)
- The world is too large for practical timelines
- The colony is temporary (just mining until deposits exhaust)
- The investment in installations and population would be better spent on a different world
- You have found a naturally habitable world nearby

**Break-Even Calculation:**
- Each terraforming installation requires construction effort, workers, and minerals
- Compare: Cost of X terraforming installations over Y years vs. Cost of building (and maintaining) the extra infrastructure those Y years
- If the world's population will grow significantly, terraforming usually wins long-term because infrastructure costs scale with population while terraforming is a fixed investment

### Target Atmosphere Composition

The ideal target atmosphere for human habitation:

| Gas | Target Partial Pressure | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Nitrogen (N2) | 0.78 atm | Primary filler gas |
| Oxygen (O2) | 0.21 atm | Breathable range |
| Carbon Dioxide (CO2) | 0.0003 atm | Minimal greenhouse, non-toxic |
| Water Vapor (H2O) | 0.01-0.03 atm | Comfortable humidity |
| All Toxics | 0.0 atm | Complete removal required |
| **Total Pressure** | **~1.0 atm** | **Earth-normal** |

This produces a colony cost contribution of 0.00 from atmospheric factors. However, perfect precision is not required -- anything in the breathable ranges eliminates the atmospheric cost penalty.

### Multi-Phase Terraforming

For complex terraforming projects, consider a phased approach:

**Phase 1 -- Immediate Colony Cost Reduction:**
- Remove the single highest-impact factor first (usually toxic gases)
- This makes the colony cheaper to maintain while further work proceeds
- Deploy early, get benefits immediately

**Phase 2 -- Temperature Adjustment:**
- Add or remove greenhouse gases to move temperature toward habitable range
- This is often the longest phase
- Each degree of temperature improvement reduces colony cost incrementally

**Phase 3 -- Atmospheric Composition:**
- Fine-tune gas levels for breathability
- Add O2 and N2 to appropriate levels
- Remove temporary greenhouse gases if needed

**Phase 4 -- Optimization:**
- Bring all values to ideal ranges
- Fine-tune pressure and composition
- Once complete, the world becomes colony cost 0.00 for atmospheric factors

> **Tip:** Terraforming is a marathon, not a sprint. Start your terraforming projects as early as possible, even if you can only afford 10-20 installations initially. Those installations working for 50 years accomplish the same as 100 installations working for 10 years. The compound benefit of early investment in terraforming is one of the most powerful long-term strategies in Aurora.
