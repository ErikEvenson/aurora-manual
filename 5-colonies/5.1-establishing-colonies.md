# 5.1 Establishing Colonies

## 5.1.1 Colony Ships

Colony ships are the primary means of establishing new colonies on surveyed bodies. They transport colonists and basic infrastructure to a new world, creating the initial settlement.

### Designing Colony Ships

Colony ships are designed in the Ship Designer using specialized components:

**Cryogenic Transport Modules:**
- The core component for colony ships, each module holds a fixed number of colonists in cryogenic suspension
- Module capacity depends on your current cryogenic transport technology level
- Multiple modules can be stacked on a single ship for larger colony expeditions
- Base capacity starts at 10,000 colonists per module at the initial tech level

**Supporting Components:**
- **Engines:** Colony ships need propulsion but are rarely speed-optimized. Commercial engines are typical.
- **Fuel Tanks:** Sufficient range to reach the target colony site. Plan for round trips if the ship will be reused.
- **Jump Drive (or escort):** Required if the colony target is in another system without jump gates.
- **Engineering Spaces:** For maintenance during long voyages, though colony ships often operate with minimal crew.

### Commercial vs. Military Colony Ships

**Commercial Colony Ships:**
- Use commercial engines (larger, slower, more fuel-efficient per ton)
- Have commercial jump drives if jump-capable
- Cheaper to build and operate
- Slower but more cost-effective for established routes
- Can be built by civilian shipyards

**Military Colony Ships:**
- Use military engines (faster, more expensive)
- Can be equipped with military jump drives
- Faster transit times, useful for emergency colonization or contested regions
- More expensive per colonist transported
- Built by naval shipyards

### Colony Ship Operations

**Loading Colonists:**
1. The colony ship must be in orbit around a colonized body with available population.
2. Issue the "Load Colonists" order. The ship will load colonists up to its capacity.
3. Population is deducted from the source colony.

**Delivering Colonists:**
1. Move the colony ship to the target body.
2. Issue the "Unload Colonists" order.
3. If no colony exists on the body, one is automatically created.
4. Colonists are added to the target colony's population.

**Cycle Operations:**
- Colony ships can be given repeating orders to continuously shuttle colonists between an established colony and a new one
- Set up a cycle: Load at homeworld, move to target, unload, move to homeworld, repeat
- This automates population transfer over time

> **Tip:** In the early game, a single colony ship making repeated trips is usually sufficient. As your empire expands, consider building 3-5 colony ships and assigning them to different routes. Civilian shipping lines will eventually begin moving colonists on their own once populations are established.

## 5.1.2 Colony Cost

Colony cost is the single most important number when evaluating a potential colony site. It determines how much infrastructure is required to support population on that world.

### What Determines Colony Cost

Colony cost is a multiplier (0.00 to 10.0+) calculated from environmental factors:

**Temperature Component:**
- Ideal: 0-35C (no penalty)
- Each degree outside the ideal range adds to colony cost
- Extreme temperatures (below -100C or above 100C) result in very high colony costs
- Temperature is the largest single contributor to colony cost for most worlds

**Atmospheric Pressure Component:**
- Ideal: 0.7-1.5 atm with breathable composition
- No atmosphere: moderate colony cost (enclosed habitation needed)
- Excessive pressure: increasing colony cost
- Dangerous gases: significant colony cost increase regardless of pressure

**Atmospheric Composition Component:**
- Breathable oxygen-nitrogen mix: no penalty
- Toxic gases present: substantial penalty per gas type
- Wrong oxygen levels (too high or too low): moderate penalty
- Excessive CO2: penalty based on concentration

**Gravity Component:**
- Ideal: 0.7-1.3g
- Low gravity (below 0.7g): minor penalty, increasing as gravity decreases
- High gravity (above 1.3g): moderate penalty, increasing with gravity
- Extreme gravity (above 2.5g): severe penalty

### Colony Cost Values and Their Meaning

| Colony Cost | Interpretation | Infrastructure Needed |
|---|---|---|
| 0.00 | Ideal (Earth-like) | None for survival |
| 0.01-0.50 | Near-ideal | Minimal |
| 0.51-1.00 | Habitable with support | Moderate |
| 1.01-2.00 | Challenging | Significant |
| 2.01-4.00 | Harsh | Very high |
| 4.01-8.00 | Extreme | Enormous |
| 8.00+ | Nearly uninhabitable | Prohibitive |

### Infrastructure Requirements

The colony cost directly determines how many infrastructure units are needed per million colonists:

- **Formula:** Required Infrastructure = Population (in millions) x Colony Cost x 100
- A colony cost of 2.0 means you need 200 infrastructure units per million people
- A colony cost of 0.0 means no infrastructure is required (the world is naturally habitable)

Infrastructure must be transported to the colony or built there using construction factories. This represents the sealed habitats, life support systems, temperature regulation, and other equipment needed to keep colonists alive.

### Reducing Effective Colony Cost

Several factors can reduce the effective colony cost:

- **Terraforming:** Changing the atmosphere and temperature can permanently reduce colony cost (see Section 5.5)
- **Technology:** Some technologies reduce the infrastructure requirements per unit of colony cost
- **Genetic Modification:** Certain research paths allow populations adapted to specific environments

> **Tip:** A colony cost of 2.0 or below is generally considered viable for large-scale colonization. Costs above 4.0 are usually only worth it for critical strategic resources. If you find a mineral-rich world with colony cost above 5.0, consider using automated mining installations instead of a populated colony.

## 5.1.3 Initial Setup

Once a colony ship delivers its first load of colonists, the new colony needs immediate attention to become self-sustaining and productive.

### First Steps After Colonization

**1. Assess the Colony:**
- Check the colony cost and current infrastructure levels
- Review available mineral deposits (from prior geological surveys)
- Note the body's temperature, atmosphere, and gravity

**2. Transport Infrastructure (if colony cost > 0):**
- Load infrastructure units onto freighters at an established colony
- Transport them to the new colony
- Without sufficient infrastructure, population will suffer and may decline
- Prioritize getting infrastructure levels above the minimum threshold

**3. Establish Basic Industry:**
- **Construction Factories:** Allow the colony to build its own installations locally, reducing dependence on transport from the homeworld
- **Mines:** Begin extracting local mineral resources
- **Research Labs (optional):** Only if the colony will specialize in research

**4. Set Up Defenses (if in contested space):**
- Ground force units for planetary defense
- Consider orbital defense platforms
- Establish sensor coverage

### Priority Installations for New Colonies

The installations you should transport first depend on the colony's purpose:

**Mining Colony:**
1. Mines (or automated mines if unpopulated)
2. Mass driver (to export minerals back to homeworld)
3. Infrastructure (to support population)
4. Maintenance facilities (to support ground operations)

**Industrial Colony:**
1. Infrastructure (to support larger population)
2. Construction factories (to build more installations locally)
3. Mines (for local resource extraction)
4. Fuel refineries (if Sorium is available locally)

**Strategic/Military Outpost:**
1. Infrastructure (minimal, just enough to support garrison)
2. Ground forces
3. Sensor installations
4. Fuel stockpiles

### Common Early-Game Colonization Targets

**In the Sol System (if using Earth start):**
- **Mars:** Low colony cost, reasonable minerals, terraforming candidate
- **Luna:** Very close to Earth, no atmosphere (moderate colony cost), often has good minerals
- **Asteroid Belt:** Multiple mining targets with automated mines
- **Jupiter's Moons:** Fuel harvesting potential plus mineral-rich moons

**In Other Systems:**
- Bodies with colony cost below 2.0 and good mineral surveys
- Gas giants with harvestable Sorium for fuel production
- Bodies at strategic jump point locations for naval bases

### Managing Multiple Colonies

As your empire grows, colony management becomes more complex:

- **Governor Assignment:** Assign governors to colonies for production bonuses
- **Shipping Routes:** Establish regular freighter routes between colonies for mineral and installation transport
- **Specialization:** Let each colony focus on what it does best (mining, industry, research, fuel production)
- **Population Balance:** Use colony ships to move population from overcrowded worlds to developing colonies

> **Tip:** Resist the urge to colonize every surveyed body. Each colony requires management attention and transport resources. Focus on high-value targets: low colony cost worlds, mineral-rich bodies, strategic locations, and fuel sources. A few well-developed colonies will outperform a dozen neglected outposts.
