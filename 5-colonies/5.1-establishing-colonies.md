# 5.1 Establishing Colonies

## 5.1.1 Colony Ships

Colony ships are the primary means of establishing new colonies on surveyed bodies. They transport colonists and basic infrastructure to a new world, creating the initial settlement.

### Designing Colony Ships

Colony ships are designed in the Ship Designer (see [Section 8 Ship Design](../8-ship-design/)) using specialized components:

**Cryogenic Transport Modules:**
- The core component for colony ships, each module holds a fixed number of colonists in cryogenic suspension
- Module capacity depends on your current cryogenic transport technology level
- Multiple modules can be stacked on a single ship for larger colony expeditions
- Base capacity starts at 10,000 colonists per module at the initial tech level

**Supporting Components:**
- **Engines:** Colony ships need propulsion but are rarely speed-optimized. Commercial engines are typical.
- **Fuel Tanks:** Sufficient range to reach the target colony site. Plan for round trips if the ship will be reused.
- **Jump Drive (or escort):** Required if the colony target is in another system without jump gates.
- **Engineering Spaces:** For maintenance during long voyages, though colony ships often operate with minimal crew.

### Commercial vs. Military Colony Ships

**Commercial Colony Ships:**
- Use commercial engines (larger, slower, more fuel-efficient per ton)
- Have commercial jump drives if jump-capable
- Cheaper to build and operate
- Slower but more cost-effective for established routes
- Can be built by civilian shipyards

**Military Colony Ships:**
- Use military engines (faster, more expensive)
- Can be equipped with military jump drives
- Faster transit times, useful for emergency colonization or contested regions
- More expensive per colonist transported
- Built by naval shipyards

### Colony Ship Operations

**Loading Colonists:**
1. The colony ship must be in orbit around a colonized body with available population.
2. Issue the "Load Colonists" order. The ship will load colonists up to its capacity.
3. Population is deducted from the source colony.

**Delivering Colonists:**
1. Move the colony ship to the target body.
2. Issue the "Unload Colonists" order.
3. If no colony exists on the body, one is automatically created.
4. Colonists are added to the target colony's population.

**Cycle Operations:**
- Colony ships can be given repeating orders to continuously shuttle colonists between an established colony and a new one
- Set up a cycle: Load at homeworld, move to target, unload, move to homeworld, repeat
- This automates population transfer over time

> **Tip:** In the early game, a single colony ship making repeated trips is usually sufficient. As your empire expands, consider building 3-5 colony ships and assigning them to different routes. Civilian shipping lines will eventually begin moving colonists on their own once populations are established.

## 5.1.2 Colony Cost

Colony cost is the single most important number when evaluating a potential colony site. It determines how much infrastructure is required to support population on that world. The final colony cost equals the highest colony cost factor from the following list of environmental checks.

### Colonization Restrictions

Certain bodies cannot be colonized at all:

- **Gas Giants and Super Jovians** cannot be colonized
- **High Gravity:** Bodies with gravity higher than the species' maximum tolerance cannot be colonized
- **Very Low Gravity:** Bodies with gravity below 0.1g cannot retain atmosphere and therefore cannot be terraformed (though they can still be colonized with infrastructure)

### What Determines Colony Cost

Colony cost is determined by taking the **single highest** cost factor from the following environmental checks. The factors are not additive -- only the worst one applies:

**Temperature Factor:**
- When surface temperature falls outside the species' temperature tolerance range, the cost factor is calculated as: Degrees outside tolerance / (Species temperature range / 2)
- For tide-locked planets, the temperature-based colony cost is reduced to 20% of normal, reflecting habitation confined to the temperate band between light and dark hemispheres
- Temperature is the largest single contributor to colony cost for most worlds

**Atmospheric Pressure Factor:**
- If atmospheric pressure exceeds the species' maximum pressure tolerance, the cost factor equals: Pressure / Species maximum pressure tolerance
- This factor has a minimum value of 2.00 (any overpressure situation is at least cost 2.0)

**Breathable Gas Factor:**
- A cost factor of 2.00 applies when the partial pressure of breathable gas (oxygen for humans) is either insufficient for respiration or exceeds 30% of total atmospheric pressure

**Dangerous Gas Factor:**
- Various atmospheric gases trigger cost factors of 2.00 or 3.00 depending on their concentration relative to specific thresholds
- Examples: Halogens (fluorine, chlorine) at 1 ppm trigger the penalty; carbon dioxide at 5,000 ppm (0.5% of atmosphere) triggers the penalty
- In C# Aurora, carbon dioxide is classified as a dangerous gas for oxygen-breathing species

**Hydrosphere Extent Factor:**
- For bodies with less than 20% water coverage, the cost factor is: (20 - Hydro Extent) / 10
- This produces values ranging from 0.0 (at 20% water) to 2.0 (at 0% water)
- Bodies with 20% or more water coverage incur no penalty from this factor

**Low Gravity Factor:**
- Bodies below the species' minimum gravity tolerance receive a cost factor of 1.00
- These worlds are designated with "(LG)" and require Low Gravity Infrastructure instead of standard infrastructure (see Section 5.4)

### Colony Cost Values and Their Meaning

| Colony Cost | Interpretation | Infrastructure Needed |
|---|---|---|
| 0.00 | Ideal (Earth-like) | None for survival |
| 0.01-0.50 | Near-ideal | Minimal |
| 0.51-1.00 | Habitable with support | Moderate |
| 1.01-2.00 | Challenging | Significant |
| 2.01-4.00 | Harsh | Very high |
| 4.01-8.00 | Extreme | Enormous |
| 8.00+ | Nearly uninhabitable | Prohibitive |

### Infrastructure Requirements

The colony cost directly determines how many infrastructure units are needed per million colonists:

- **Formula:** Required Infrastructure = Population (in millions) x Colony Cost x 200
- A colony cost of 2.0 means you need 400 infrastructure units per million people
- A colony cost of 0.0 means no infrastructure is required (the world is naturally habitable)
- Low Gravity worlds require LG-Infrastructure at the same ratio of 200 per million population

Infrastructure must be transported to the colony or built there using construction factories. This represents the sealed habitats, life support systems, temperature regulation, and other equipment needed to keep colonists alive.

### Reducing Effective Colony Cost

Several factors can reduce the effective colony cost:

- **Terraforming:** Changing the atmosphere, temperature, or hydrosphere can permanently reduce colony cost (see Section 5.5)
- **Technology:** Some technologies reduce the infrastructure requirements per unit of colony cost
- **Genetic Modification:** Certain research paths allow populations adapted to specific environments, effectively shifting what counts as "ideal" conditions for that species

> **Tip:** A colony cost of 2.0 or below is generally considered viable for large-scale colonization. Costs above 4.0 are usually only worth it for critical strategic resources. If you find a mineral-rich world with colony cost above 5.0, consider using automated mining installations instead of a populated colony.

### Colony Cost Projection

The System View window includes a colony cost projection feature that projects colony cost into the future based on various time intervals (weeks, months, quarters, years, up to centuries). This is particularly useful for bodies with eccentric orbits, where colony cost changes as distance from the parent star varies.

**Projection Granularity:**
- **Wide view with SM mode:** Up to 12 future periods per granularity level
- **Wide view without SM mode:** Up to 12 future periods
- **Normal view without SM mode:** Up to 7 future periods

**Orbital Limitations:**
- For planets, projections extend up to one complete orbit
- For moons, projections show one orbit of the parent body
- Example: Mars displays 12 future months but only 2 future years; Pluto can project 300 years ahead due to its 248-year orbit

Bodies with very long orbital periods and extreme distances (such as Pluto) show minimal cost variation across projected periods since they cannot get significantly colder.

### Colony Cost of Comets

In C# Aurora, comet colony costs are dynamic rather than static. Temperature and colony cost update in real time as comets move toward and away from the parent star. The System View displays current distance rather than maximum distance, and players can toggle between current and maximum colony cost viewing in the System View, Economics window Colony Summary, and the Tactical Map's Body Info tab.

**Dynamic Population Capacity:**
Since infrastructure supports population based on colony cost, population capacity fluctuates as comets orbit. A comet approaching perihelion may support fewer or more colonists depending on temperature changes.

**Civilian Traffic Restrictions:**
The Unload Colonists standing order will ignore comets, preventing automated civilian traffic from depositing colonists on bodies that may be ejected from the system or experience extreme environmental changes.

### Potential Colony Locations

Rather than a separate window, the colony site search function is integrated into the System View window. Players can click "All System View" to access search filters across all systems simultaneously.

**Search Filters:**
- Colony cost thresholds
- Mineral presence
- Gravity acceptability
- Oxygen atmosphere
- Population capacity minimums
- Ownership (excluding alien-controlled systems)

**Sorting Options:**
- Colony cost (primary)
- Hydro extent
- Mineral deposit size

This integrated approach allows narrowing the search for potential colony sites across all systems while retaining all the functionality of the System View window, eliminating the need to switch between multiple interfaces.

## 5.1.3 Conventional Start

The Conventional Start is a game setup option that provides players with a pre-industrial civilisation that has not yet discovered Trans-Newtonian Theory. This represents a modern-day or near-future civilisation beginning its expansion into space.

### Starting Installations

The conventional start provides the following facilities, scaled based on starting population:

**Shipyard Facilities:**
- 1,000-ton Naval Shipyard
- 10,000-ton Commercial Shipyard

**Research and Development:**
- Research Facilities proportional to manufacturing population: one facility per 12 million manufacturing population

**Military Infrastructure:**
- Military Academy
- Naval Headquarters
- 5 Maintenance Facilities

**Economic Facilities:**
- Spaceport
- Conventional Industry equal to eight times the manufacturing population in millions

**Support Infrastructure:**
- Deep Space Tracking Station
- Infrastructure as needed for the colony cost

### Population-Based Scaling

The setup scales based on initial population. For example, a starting population of one billion will have approximately 1,600 conventional factories and 16 research facilities.

### Conventional Industry

Conventional Industry is a general-purpose installation available before the discovery of Trans-Newtonian Theory. Each unit of Conventional Industry provides the combined output of:

- 0.1 Construction Factories
- 0.05 Ordnance Factories
- 0.025 Fighter Factories
- 0.05 Fuel Refineries
- 0.1 Financial Centres
- 0.15 Mines

This means 10 Conventional Industry units produce the equivalent of 1 Construction Factory, and approximately 7 units equal 1 Mine. While versatile, Conventional Industry is far less efficient than dedicated TN installations and should be replaced as soon as possible after researching Trans-Newtonian Theory.

### Converting Conventional Industry

Once Trans-Newtonian Theory is researched, Conventional Industry can be converted to dedicated Financial Centres at a cost of 20 Build Points each, requiring 10 Corbomite and 10 Uridium per conversion.

### Installations Available Before Trans-Newtonian Theory

Since players start with certain installations in a conventional start, it does not make sense to require Trans-Newtonian Theory for their construction. The following 14 installations can be built without any advanced technology:

- Naval Shipyard Complex
- Commercial Shipyard Complex
- Research Facility
- Spaceport
- Ground Force Construction Complex
- Military Academy
- Naval Headquarters
- Refuelling Station
- Ordnance Transfer Station
- Cargo Shuttle Station
- Maintenance Facility
- Financial Centre
- Deep Space Tracking Station
- Infrastructure

This allows early-game expansion of basic infrastructure and support facilities without gating progress behind advanced technology requirements.

### Key Differences from Trans-Newtonian Start

- No missile bases or ICBMs are included in the conventional start
- All starting installations listed above can be constructed before Trans-Newtonian Theory research
- The focus is on early naval and industrial capability development
- Players must research TN Theory before building specialised installations (mines, construction factories, fuel refineries, etc.)

> **Tip:** In a conventional start, your first research priority should be Trans-Newtonian Theory. Until that is complete, you are limited to Conventional Industry for all production. Once TN Theory is researched, immediately begin building dedicated Construction Factories and Mines to replace the less efficient conventional factories.

## 5.1.4 Initial Setup

Once a colony ship delivers its first load of colonists, the new colony needs immediate attention to become self-sustaining and productive.

### First Steps After Colonization

**1. Assess the Colony:**
- Check the colony cost and current infrastructure levels
- Review available mineral deposits (from prior geological surveys)
- Note the body's temperature, atmosphere, and gravity

**2. Transport Infrastructure (if colony cost > 0):**
- Load infrastructure units onto freighters at an established colony
- Transport them to the new colony
- Without sufficient infrastructure, population will suffer and may decline
- Prioritize getting infrastructure levels above the minimum threshold

**3. Establish Basic Industry:**
- **Construction Factories:** Allow the colony to build its own installations locally, reducing dependence on transport from the homeworld
- **Mines:** Begin extracting local mineral resources
- **Research Labs (optional):** Only if the colony will specialize in research

**4. Set Up Defenses (if in contested space):**
- Ground force units for planetary defense
- Consider orbital defense platforms
- Establish sensor coverage

### Priority Installations for New Colonies

The installations you should transport first depend on the colony's purpose:

**Mining Colony:**
1. Mines (or automated mines if unpopulated)
2. Mass driver (to export minerals back to homeworld)
3. Infrastructure (to support population)
4. Maintenance facilities (to support ground operations)

**Industrial Colony:**
1. Infrastructure (to support larger population)
2. Construction factories (to build more installations locally)
3. Mines (for local resource extraction)
4. Fuel refineries (if Sorium is available locally)

**Strategic/Military Outpost:**
1. Infrastructure (minimal, just enough to support garrison)
2. Ground forces
3. Sensor installations
4. Fuel stockpiles

### Common Early-Game Colonization Targets

**In the Sol System (if using Earth start):**
- **Mars:** Low colony cost, reasonable minerals, terraforming candidate
- **Luna:** Very close to Earth, no atmosphere (moderate colony cost), often has good minerals
- **Asteroid Belt:** Multiple mining targets with automated mines
- **Jupiter's Moons:** Fuel harvesting potential plus mineral-rich moons

**In Other Systems:**
- Bodies with colony cost below 2.0 and good mineral surveys
- Gas giants with harvestable Sorium for fuel production
- Bodies at strategic jump point locations for naval bases

### Managing Multiple Colonies

As your empire grows, colony management becomes more complex:

- **Governor Assignment:** Assign governors (see [Section 16 Commanders](../16-commanders/)) to colonies for production bonuses
- **Shipping Routes:** Establish regular freighter routes (see [Section 14 Logistics](../14-logistics/)) between colonies for mineral and installation transport
- **Specialization:** Let each colony focus on what it does best (mining, industry, research, fuel production)
- **Population Balance:** Use colony ships to move population from overcrowded worlds to developing colonies

> **Tip:** Resist the urge to colonize every surveyed body. Each colony requires management attention and transport resources. Focus on high-value targets: low colony cost worlds, mineral-rich bodies, strategic locations, and fuel sources. A few well-developed colonies will outperform a dozen neglected outposts.

## 5.1.5 Deep Space Populations

Deep Space Populations (DSPs) are colonies established in open space rather than on a planetary body. They can be created by clicking a button on the Tactical Map's Miscellaneous tab, selecting a location, and choosing a name. DSPs appear as yellow dots on maps and function as populations with significant restrictions.

### Core Limitations

DSPs lack an associated system body, which means:
- No survey destination capability
- No mineral deposits exist at the location
- Cannot receive installations
- Cannot store population (except via Ark Modules), fuel, MSP, ground units, or ship components
- Ground combat cannot occur (both attack and defense are impossible)
- Environmental tab displays blank information
- Cannot be made independent

### Operational Capabilities

Despite their limitations, DSPs support several useful functions:
- **Mineral Storage:** Minerals can be delivered to and collected from DSPs (stored as free-floating resources)
- **Shore Leave:** DSPs can provide ship shore leave if equipped with Recreation Modules
- **Maintenance:** Maintenance Modules and Repair Bays can operate at DSPs, using ship-carried MSP and minerals for repairs
- **Shipyards:** Shipyards can operate at DSPs but require Ark Module-based populations
- **Repair Bays:** Function without population requirements

### Population Requirements

Only Ark Modules can provide population to DSPs. Both orbital and surface populations generate trade goods, meaning an orbital-only colony including a DSP will produce trade goods. Infrastructure and PPV requirements consider only surface-based colonists.

### Movement and Location

DSPs do not orbit the system's sun and normally remain stationary at their creation point. However, clicking on a gas giant while creating a DSP will place it in orbit around that gas giant, causing it to follow the planet's orbital path. This is useful for establishing permanent fuel harvesting or logistics operations at gas giants. Movement orders are limited to those available for waypoints plus mineral-related operations.

## 5.1.6 Deleting Empty Colonies

The "Delete Empty" button provides a utility for cleaning up abandoned colonies, particularly useful since ground survey mechanics create many temporary settlement outposts during exploration.

### Deletion Criteria

A colony is only eligible for deletion when **all** of the following conditions are met:
- No colonist population present
- No installations exist
- No abandoned installations remain
- No ground forces stationed there
- No ordnance stockpiled
- No component storage
- No orbiting fleets
- No fleets using it as a destination
- Zero ground survey potential remaining
- Colony not flagged as exempt

### Protection Mechanism

An "Empty Exempt" toggle allows players to mark colonies they intend to develop later, preventing accidental deletion. This exempt status displays on the colony summary for reference.

## 5.1.7 Populations as Text

The "Pop as Text" feature is a utility located in the Economics window designed to assist with After-Action Reports (AARs). It converts population data into formatted text for easy copying.

**Two buttons are available:**
- **Pop as Text:** Displays information for a single selected population
- **All Pop as Text:** Generates text for all populations simultaneously

**Data displayed includes:**
- Population amount
- Naval shipyard capacity
- Commercial shipyard capacity
- Maintenance capacity
- Installation counts (Research Facility, Ground Force Construction Complex, Construction Factory, etc.)

The text is automatically highlighted for immediate copying with Ctrl-C. When using "All Pop as Text," populations appear in the same order as the population tree on the left of the Economics window.
