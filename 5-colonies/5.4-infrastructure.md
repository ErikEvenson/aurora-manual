## 5.4.1 Installation Types

Installations are the buildings and facilities that make a colony functional. Each type serves a specific purpose, from resource extraction to manufacturing to defense.

### Resource Extraction

**Mines:**

- Extract minerals from planetary deposits
- Production rate depends on deposit accessibility and technology level
- Each mine employs approximately 50,000 workers \hyperlink{ref-5.4-1}{[1]}
- Output formula: Base production x Accessibility x Tech modifier
- Mines are the backbone of any resource-producing colony

**Automated Mines:**

- Function like standard mines but require no population
- Produce at the same base rate as conventional mines (10 tons/year x accessibility) \hyperlink{ref-5.4-2}{[2]}
- Build Cost: 240 BP (vs 120 BP for conventional mines) \hyperlink{ref-5.4-2}{[2]}
- Conversion Cost: 150 BP to convert a conventional mine to automated \hyperlink{ref-5.4-3}{[3]}
- Ideal for low-population bodies, asteroids, and remote locations
- No infrastructure requirement (they provide their own life support)
- Cannot benefit from governor mining bonuses that require population

**Fuel Refineries:**

- Convert raw Sorium into refined fuel (Fuel Units)
- Workers: 50,000 per refinery \hyperlink{ref-5.4-1}{[1]}
- Base Output: 40,000 litres of fuel per year (upgradeable via research) \hyperlink{ref-5.4-4}{[4]}
- Consumption: 1 ton of Sorium per 2,000 litres of fuel produced *(unverified -- conversion rate not stored in database)*
- Essential for maintaining fleet operations
- Requires Sorium deposits on the colony or Sorium transported in
- Multiple refineries can operate simultaneously

**Fuel Harvesters:**

- Specialized installations deployed on gas giants to extract Sorium from the atmosphere
- Can only be placed on gas giant-class bodies
- Production rate depends on the gas giant's Sorium concentration
- No mineral deposit required -- they harvest from the atmosphere directly
- A key source of fuel for empires without easily accessible Sorium deposits

### Manufacturing

**Construction Factories:**

- Build installations, infrastructure, and ground force components
- Workers: 50,000 per factory \hyperlink{ref-5.4-1}{[1]}
- Base Output: 10 BP/year/factory (upgradeable via research) \hyperlink{ref-5.4-5}{[5]}
- The primary means of expanding colony capability
- Construction queue is managed through the colony's Economics tab
- Can build any ground-based installation or component

**Ordnance Factories:**

- Manufacture missiles, torpedoes, and other expendable ordnance (see [Section 12.1 Fire Controls](../12-combat/12.1-fire-controls.md))
- Workers: 50,000 per factory \hyperlink{ref-5.4-1}{[1]}
- Base Output: 10 BP/year/factory (upgradeable via research) \hyperlink{ref-5.4-5}{[5]}
- Essential for maintaining missile-equipped fleets
- Ordnance requires specific minerals depending on the design
- Strategic importance: running out of missiles in wartime is catastrophic

**Fighter Factories:**

- Build small craft (fighters, FACs, shuttles) that are too small for shipyard construction
- Workers: 50,000 per factory \hyperlink{ref-5.4-1}{[1]}
- Base Output: 10 BP/year/factory (upgradeable via research) \hyperlink{ref-5.4-5}{[5]}
- Fighter factories can produce any fighter design in your database
- Important for carrier-based fleet doctrines

### Research and Development

**Research Labs:**

- Generate research points applied to your current research projects (see [Section 7.1 Technology Tree](../7-research/7.1-technology-tree.md))
- Workers: 1,000,000 per lab \hyperlink{ref-5.4-1}{[1]}
- Base Output: 200 RP/year/lab (upgradeable via research) \hyperlink{ref-5.4-6}{[6]}
- Scientists (commanders assigned to research) multiply lab output
- More labs = faster research, but only up to the limits of your assigned scientists
- Can specialize in specific research fields for bonus efficiency

### Economy and Logistics

**Financial Centres:**

- Generate supplementary wealth equal to the tax from 250,000 workers per centre \hyperlink{ref-5.4-7}{[7]}
- Unlike VB6, financial centres can be transported between colonies
- Conventional Factories function as 1/10th of a Financial Centre \hyperlink{ref-5.4-8}{[8]}
- Conventional Factories can be converted to full Financial Centres at a cost of 20 BP, requiring 20 Corbomite \hyperlink{ref-5.4-9}{[9]}
- Each centre employs 50,000 workers \hyperlink{ref-5.4-1}{[1]}
- Essential on your homeworld and major colonies

**Mass Drivers:**

- Launch mineral packets to other colonies with mass driver receivers
- Capacity: 5,000 tons of minerals per year to any colony in the same system *(unverified -- mass driver capacity not stored in installation table)*
- Packets travel at high speed but require a receiver at the destination
- Without a receiver, packets crash and are lost
- Critical for asteroid mining networks

**Mass Driver Receivers:**

- Catch incoming mineral packets from mass drivers
- Must be present at the receiving colony
- One receiver can handle multiple incoming streams
- Install these at your central collection colonies

### Sensor and Detection

**Deep Space Tracking Station:**

- Provides ground-based sensor capability for detecting ships and contacts (see [Section 11.1 Thermal and EM Signatures](../11-sensors-and-detection/11.1-thermal-em-signatures.md))
- Base Rating: 200 (upgradeable via research) \hyperlink{ref-5.4-10}{[10]}
- Allows detection of vessels transiting through or near the system
- Critical for early warning of approaching hostile forces

### Military and Defense

**Ground Force Training Facilities:**

- Train ground combat units (see [Section 13.1 Unit Types and Formation Design](../13-ground-forces/13.1-unit-types.md)) (infantry, armor, artillery, etc.)
- Workers: 1,000,000 per facility \hyperlink{ref-5.4-1}{[1]}
- Training time depends on unit complexity and facility capacity
- Essential for maintaining a ground defense force
- Can train various unit types depending on your ground force designs

**Maintenance Facilities:**

- Provide maintenance supplies to ships in orbit and ground installations
- Each facility generates maintenance supply points per year
- Ships without regular maintenance suffer progressive degradation
- Critical for forward naval bases and shipyard locations
- Cost: 60 Build Points in C# Aurora (reduced from previous versions) \hyperlink{ref-5.4-11}{[11]}

**Naval Shipyards:**

- Build and repair ships (covered in detail in the Naval section)
- Technically an installation but managed through the shipyard interface
- Requires population, minerals, and time to construct ships
- Can be expanded (more slipways) or upgraded (larger capacity)

### Terraforming

**Terraforming Installations:**

- Modify a planet's atmosphere by adding or removing specific gases
- Base Output: 0.00025 atm/year per installation at starting technology (upgradeable via research) \hyperlink{ref-5.4-12}{[12]}
- Rate modified by planet size: Earth Surface Area / Planet Surface Area (smaller worlds terraform faster) *(unverified -- size modifier formula not stored in database)*
- Must be assigned a specific gas to add or remove
- Multiple installations accelerate the terraforming process
- Covered in detail in [Section 5.5 Terraforming](5.5-terraforming.md)

### Forced Labour

**Forced Labour Construction Camps:**

- Provide output equivalent to one Construction Factory \hyperlink{ref-5.4-13}{[13]}
- Build cost: 40 BP each \hyperlink{ref-5.4-13}{[13]}
- Transport size: 100,000 cargo points (4x a standard construction factory) \hyperlink{ref-5.4-13}{[13]}
- Consume 100,000 population upon construction *(unverified -- gameplay mechanic)*
- Require only 5,000 population as overseers for ongoing operation \hyperlink{ref-5.4-13}{[13]}
- Cause 5 points of unrest instantly when built *(unverified -- gameplay mechanic)*
- Respond to all standard production modifiers (radiation, unrest, economic, political)
- Can be built at any population, not exclusively occupied ones

**Forced Labour Mining Camps:**

- Provide output equivalent to one Mine
- Same build cost, transport size, population consumption, and unrest as construction camps
- Otherwise identical mechanics to Forced Labour Construction Camps

> **Note:** Workers in Forced Labour Camps do not generate wealth. See [Section 5.2 Population](5.2-population.md) for detailed strategic analysis of these installations.

### Population Support

**Infrastructure:**

- Not a traditional installation but a critical colony component
- Supports population on worlds with colony costs above 0.00
- Required amount = Population (millions) x Colony Cost x 100
- Can be built by construction factories, transported by freighters, or produced by civilian shipping lines
- Represents sealed habitats, life support, climate control, etc.
- Costs 2 Build Points per unit to construct \hyperlink{ref-5.4-14}{[14]}

**Civilian Infrastructure Production:**

- Civilian shipping lines produce infrastructure for colonies with colony cost > 0, free of charge to the government
- **Formula:** Infrastructure produced = 2 x Population (in millions) per year *(unverified -- civilian production formula not stored in database)*
- Only colonies with colony cost > 0 demand and receive civilian infrastructure
- This production generates wealth for the shipping line while costing the player nothing
- On low-gravity worlds, civilian production generates LG-Infrastructure at one-third the normal rate
- A colony of 10 million on a CC 2.0 world receives approximately 20 infrastructure units per year from civilian production alone
- This supplements but does not replace government construction, especially in the early stages of colonization when infrastructure needs are urgent

**Low Gravity Infrastructure (LG-Infrastructure):**

- Required for bodies below the species' minimum gravity tolerance (designated "(LG)" in the mineral survey window)
- The low gravity threshold is approximately 0.38g -- bodies at or above this value (such as Mercury at 0.38g) are not considered low gravity, while bodies below it (such as Luna and most smaller moons) are *(unverified -- the actual threshold depends on species minimum gravity tolerance, which is 0.1g for default humans per database)*
- Costs 4 Build Points per unit (twice the cost of standard infrastructure), effectively doubling the infrastructure investment needed for LG worlds *(unverified -- LG-Infrastructure is not listed as a separate installation in the database; it appears to be a variant of standard Infrastructure)*
- Built and transported in the same way as regular infrastructure
- Supports population at the same ratio: Colony Cost x 100 LG-Infrastructure per million population
- Worlds within tolerable gravity ranges accept both normal and LG-Infrastructure
- Worlds above the species' maximum gravity cannot be colonized at all
- Civilian infrastructure production on low-gravity worlds generates LG-Infrastructure at one-third the normal rate (same overall cost due to the 2x BP cost)
- Infrastructure trade routes follow strict categorisation: LG-Infrastructure only transfers to low-gravity worlds

> **Warning:** The doubled build cost of LG-Infrastructure is a significant economic consideration when evaluating colonization targets. A mineral-rich moon flagged as LG requires twice the construction investment in infrastructure compared to a similar body with normal gravity. Factor this into your colony planning, especially in the early game when build points are scarce.

**Maintenance Facilities** are also essential for population support -- see the full description under [Military and Defense](#military-and-defense) above.

> **Tip:** When setting up a new colony, prioritize installations in this order: Infrastructure (to keep people alive), Mines (to extract resources), Construction Factories (to build everything else locally). Once these three are established, the colony can grow semi-independently.

## 5.4.2 Building Installations

Installations can be created in two ways: built locally by construction factories or transported from another colony.

### Local Construction

**Using Construction Factories:**

1. Open the colony's Economics tab
2. Select the installation type to build from the construction queue dropdown
3. Set the desired quantity
4. The colony's construction factories will begin producing the installation
5. Completed installations are automatically added to the colony

**Construction Rate:**

- Each factory has a base construction rate determined by technology
- Rate is measured in Build Points (BP) per year
- Each installation type has a BP cost
- Time to build = Installation BP Cost / (Number of Factories x BP per Factory per Year)
- More factories = faster construction

**Construction Priorities:**

- The construction queue is processed in order from top to bottom
- You can reorder queue items to prioritize urgent needs
- Multiple items can be queued simultaneously
- Construction splits evenly across all items at the same priority level (or in order, depending on settings)

**Mineral Requirements:**

- Each installation type requires specific minerals to build
- If minerals are unavailable, construction halts for that item
- Common mineral requirements: \hyperlink{ref-5.4-17}{[17]}
  - Mines: 120 Corundium
  - Construction Factories: 60 Duranium, 60 Neutronium
  - Infrastructure: 1 Duranium, 1 Mercassium
  - Research Facilities: 1,200 Duranium, 1,200 Mercassium
  - Fuel Refineries: 120 Boronide

### Transport from Elsewhere

**Using Freighters:**

1. Build installations at an established colony (usually your homeworld)
2. Load installations onto freighters using the "Load Installation" order
3. Transport to the target colony
4. Unload installations using the "Unload Installation" order
5. Installations are immediately operational at the destination

**Advantages of Transport:**

- Faster than building locally if the destination lacks construction factories
- Can leverage the homeworld's superior industrial capacity
- Useful for bootstrapping new colonies quickly

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires freighter capacity and fuel
- Transit time can be significant for distant colonies
- Ties up transport ships that could be used for other purposes

### Mixed Strategy

The most efficient approach combines both methods:

1. **Initial Bootstrap:** Transport a batch of construction factories and mines from an established colony
2. **Local Growth:** Use the transported factories to build additional installations locally
3. **Supplement as Needed:** Continue transporting critical installations while local production ramps up
4. **Self-Sufficiency:** Eventually the colony can build everything it needs locally

> **Tip:** A colony needs approximately 20-30 construction factories to be reasonably self-sufficient for installation production. Below that, it's usually faster to transport installations from your homeworld. Above that, the colony can handle most of its own construction needs. The exact break-even depends on transit times and freighter availability.

### Installation Transport Requirements (v2.0.0+)

Key installations were made more transportable as of v2.0.0, with cargo hold requirements halved:

| Installation | Cargo Holds Required |
|---|---|
| Naval Headquarters | 10 holds \hyperlink{ref-5.4-15}{[15]} |
| Spaceport | 40 holds \hyperlink{ref-5.4-15}{[15]} |

These reductions make establishing forward bases significantly less logistically demanding.

### Scrapping Installations

Installations can be scrapped to recover a portion of their original investment. The scrapping function is located in the Civilian Economy tab of the Economics window.

**Return Value:** Scrapping installations returns **30% of their wealth and minerals**. *(unverified -- scrap return rate not stored in database)*

**Resource Recovery:**

- **Wealth:** Added to the racial balance
- **Minerals:** Deposited into the parent population's stockpile

**Process:**

1. Select an installation type in the Civilian Economy tab
2. Click the "Scrap Installation" button
3. Select how many installations to scrap (fractional quantities are supported as of v2.1.0, allowing partial installation scrapping)
4. All selected installations are processed simultaneously

This mechanic allows players to recover partial value from surplus or unwanted installations, providing a method to manage infrastructure without total loss.

### SpaceMaster Installation Management

When in SpaceMaster mode, the Civilian Economy tab gains additional interface elements -- an extra dropdown and three extra buttons -- that expand the SpaceMaster's ability to modify colony infrastructure.

**SpaceMaster Capabilities:**

- **Change installation quantities:** Adjust the number of existing installations at any colony
- **Add new installation types:** Introduce installations that were not previously present at a location

This functionality replaces part of the functionality from the VB6 SM Modification window, consolidating features into a more streamlined interface within the Economics window's Civilian Economy tab.

## 5.4.3 Capacity and Limits

While there is no hard cap on the number of installations a colony can have, practical limitations determine the optimal size of your colony's industrial base.

### Population Limits

The most common constraint on installation count is population:

- Each installation (except automated mines) requires workers
- Total employment = Sum of all installations x workers per installation
- If employment exceeds population, installations operate at reduced efficiency
- Adding more installations past the staffing limit provides diminishing returns

**Practical Guideline:**

- 1 million population supports approximately 20 conventional mines or factories \hyperlink{ref-5.4-16}{[16]}
- 10 million population supports approximately 200 installations
- Scale installations to match available workforce

### Mineral Availability

Installations are limited by the minerals available for construction and operation:

**Construction Minerals:**

- Building installations requires minerals from local deposits or imports
- If a colony runs out of Duranium, most construction halts
- Plan mineral imports for colonies with poor local deposits

**Operational Resources:**

- Fuel refineries need Sorium
- Ordnance factories need various minerals per missile design
- Fighter factories need minerals per fighter design
- Running out of input materials idles the installation

### Maintenance Considerations

All installations require some maintenance over time:

- Installations gradually degrade without maintenance
- Maintenance facilities provide maintenance supply points
- Insufficient maintenance leads to installation breakdown
- Replacement of failed installations costs additional construction time and minerals
- A general guideline: 1 maintenance facility per 20-30 installations *(unverified -- community guideline)*

### Governor Bonuses and Efficiency

Governors assigned to colonies provide percentage bonuses to various activities:

- **Mining Bonus:** Increases per-mine output (effectively making fewer mines produce more)
- **Manufacturing Bonus:** Increases construction factory output
- **Research Bonus:** Increases research lab output
- **Population Growth Bonus:** Increases growth rate

These bonuses effectively increase the value of each installation, making it more efficient to have fewer boosted installations than many unboosted ones.

### Diminishing Returns Considerations

While individual installations don't suffer diminishing returns, the overall colony system can:

**Transport Bottleneck:**

- More mines produce more minerals, but if you can't ship them out, they just stockpile
- Plan transport capacity to match production

**Mineral Depletion:**

- High mining rates deplete deposits faster
- A 100-mine colony on a small asteroid will exhaust deposits quickly
- Match mining capacity to deposit size for longevity

**Research Limits:**

- Research labs are only useful up to the point your scientists can utilize them
- Each scientist has a maximum number of labs they can effectively manage
- Building 500 labs without enough scientists wastes capacity

### Optimal Colony Sizes by Purpose

**Mining Colony (Small Body):**

- 5-20 automated mines
- 1-2 mass drivers
- No population required
- Minimal investment, steady returns

**Mining Colony (Large Body):**

- 50-200 conventional mines
- 5-20 construction factories (for local maintenance)
- 2-5 mass drivers or regular freighter pickup
- 5-15 million population
- Infrastructure appropriate to colony cost

**Industrial Hub:**

- 100-500 construction factories
- 50-200 mines (for local minerals)
- 20-50 maintenance facilities
- Multiple shipyards
- 50-200 million population
- Major infrastructure investment

**Research Colony:**

- 50-200 research labs
- Minimal mining (import minerals)
- 10-50 million population
- Assign top scientists here
- Low colony cost world preferred (less infrastructure overhead)

**Fuel Production Colony:**

- 50-200 fuel harvesters (on gas giant) or fuel refineries (on Sorium-rich body)
- Fuel stockpile storage
- 5-30 million population (or automated if possible)
- Critical strategic installation -- protect it

> **Tip:** Don't try to make every colony do everything. Specialization is more efficient than generalization. A colony with 200 construction factories and 200 mines needs 20 million workers, but a colony with 200 factories and a separate colony with 200 mines each needs only 10 million -- and you can optimize each colony's conditions for its purpose.

## 5.4.4 Space Stations

Space Stations in C# Aurora are a distinct class of orbital structure defined by their construction method rather than traditional ship design.

### Classification

Any ship class featuring a **Structural Shell** instead of standard armour is classified as a Space Station. This design choice has several important implications:

- **Civilian Construction:** Space Stations can be built by civilian construction factories at any population with a Spaceport, eliminating the requirement for dedicated orbital construction infrastructure
- **No Engines:** Space Stations cannot have engines -- they must be towed to their destination
- **No Military Systems:** Space Stations cannot mount weapons or military-grade sensors
- **Minimal Protection:** The structural shell provides only 1 armour per unit with a strength of 20, making it essentially 5% of the cost of normal armour. The structural shell does not prevent damage -- weapon fire passes straight through *(unverified -- structural shell stats not in installation database)*

### Practical Applications

Space Stations serve specialised non-combat functions:

- **Fuel Harvesting Platforms:** Stationed at gas giants for Sorium collection
- **Mining Stations:** Positioned near asteroid fields for extraction operations
- **Orbital Habitats:** Providing population capacity in orbit (see [Section 14.4 Orbital Habitats](../14-logistics/14.4-orbital-habitats.md))
- **Fleet Support Bases:** Offering maintenance, refuelling, and ordnance transfer without weapons

### Example: Fleet Base Design

A typical fleet base space station might include:

- Large hangar capacity (e.g., 20,000 tons) for small craft servicing
- Maintenance modules supporting large ship overhauls (e.g., 128,000-ton capacity)
- Substantial fuel storage for fleet refuelling operations
- Ordnance transfer systems for rearming combat vessels
- All within an unarmoured, stationary framework defended by separate military assets

### Defence Considerations

Despite their vulnerability, Space Stations gain protection through:

- **Defensive Bases:** Separate armed platforms maintaining permanent presence alongside the station
- **Fleet Presence:** Combat ships assigned to protect the station's location
- **Strategic Placement:** Positioning stations in secure interior systems away from border threats

> **Tip:** Space Stations are extremely cost-effective for logistics and support roles. Since they do not need engines, fuel, or weapons, nearly all their tonnage goes toward their actual function. A fleet base station provides far more maintenance and logistics capacity per ton than an equivalent warship-based support vessel.
