# 5.4 Infrastructure

## 5.4.1 Installation Types

Installations are the buildings and facilities that make a colony functional. Each type serves a specific purpose, from resource extraction to manufacturing to defense.

### Resource Extraction

**Mines:**
- Extract minerals from planetary deposits
- Production rate depends on deposit accessibility and technology level
- Each mine employs approximately 50,000 workers
- Output formula: Base production x Accessibility x Tech modifier
- Mines are the backbone of any resource-producing colony

**Automated Mines:**
- Function like standard mines but require no population
- Produce at approximately 50% the rate of conventional mines
- Ideal for low-population bodies, asteroids, and remote locations
- No infrastructure requirement (they provide their own life support)
- Cannot benefit from governor mining bonuses that require population

**Fuel Refineries:**
- Convert raw Sorium into refined fuel (Fuel Units)
- Essential for maintaining fleet operations
- Each refinery produces a fixed amount of fuel per year based on tech level
- Requires Sorium deposits on the colony or Sorium transported in
- Multiple refineries can operate simultaneously

**Fuel Harvesters:**
- Specialized installations deployed on gas giants to extract Sorium from the atmosphere
- Can only be placed on gas giant-class bodies
- Production rate depends on the gas giant's Sorium concentration
- No mineral deposit required -- they harvest from the atmosphere directly
- A key source of fuel for empires without easily accessible Sorium deposits

### Manufacturing

**Construction Factories:**
- Build installations, infrastructure, and ground force components
- The primary means of expanding colony capability
- Each factory has a build rate determined by technology level
- Construction queue is managed through the colony's Economics tab
- Can build any ground-based installation or component

**Ordnance Factories:**
- Manufacture missiles, torpedoes, and other expendable ordnance
- Essential for maintaining missile-equipped fleets
- Production rate depends on tech level and missile complexity
- Ordnance requires specific minerals depending on the design
- Strategic importance: running out of missiles in wartime is catastrophic

**Fighter Factories:**
- Build small craft (fighters, FACs, shuttles) that are too small for shipyard construction
- Production rate depends on tech level and fighter design complexity
- Fighter factories can produce any fighter design in your database
- Important for carrier-based fleet doctrines

### Research and Development

**Research Labs:**
- Generate research points applied to your current research projects
- Each lab contributes a fixed amount of research per year based on tech level
- Scientists (commanders assigned to research) multiply lab output
- More labs = faster research, but only up to the limits of your assigned scientists
- Can specialize in specific research fields for bonus efficiency

### Economy and Logistics

**Financial Centers:**
- Generate wealth from the colony's economic activity
- Wealth pays for ship maintenance, crew salaries, and other costs
- More centers = more income, but subject to diminishing returns relative to population
- Essential on your homeworld and major colonies

**Mass Drivers:**
- Launch mineral packets to other colonies with mass driver receivers
- Each mass driver can launch a fixed tonnage per year
- Packets travel at high speed but require a receiver at the destination
- Without a receiver, packets crash and are lost
- Critical for asteroid mining networks

**Mass Driver Receivers:**
- Catch incoming mineral packets from mass drivers
- Must be present at the receiving colony
- One receiver can handle multiple incoming streams
- Install these at your central collection colonies

### Military and Defense

**Ground Force Training Facilities:**
- Train ground combat units (infantry, armor, artillery, etc.)
- Training time depends on unit complexity and facility capacity
- Essential for maintaining a ground defense force
- Can train various unit types depending on your ground force designs

**Maintenance Facilities:**
- Provide maintenance supplies to ships in orbit and ground installations
- Each facility generates maintenance supply points per year
- Ships without regular maintenance suffer progressive degradation
- Critical for forward naval bases and shipyard locations

**Naval Shipyards:**
- Build and repair ships (covered in detail in the Naval section)
- Technically an installation but managed through the shipyard interface
- Requires population, minerals, and time to construct ships
- Can be expanded (more slipways) or upgraded (larger capacity)

### Terraforming

**Terraforming Installations:**
- Modify a planet's atmosphere by adding or removing specific gases
- Each installation processes a fixed amount of gas per year
- Must be assigned a specific gas to add or remove
- Multiple installations accelerate the terraforming process
- Covered in detail in Section 5.5

### Population Support

**Infrastructure:**
- Not a traditional installation but a critical colony component
- Supports population on worlds with colony costs above 0.00
- Required amount = Population (millions) x Colony Cost x 100
- Can be built by construction factories or transported by freighters
- Represents sealed habitats, life support, climate control, etc.

> **Tip:** When setting up a new colony, prioritize installations in this order: Infrastructure (to keep people alive), Mines (to extract resources), Construction Factories (to build everything else locally). Once these three are established, the colony can grow semi-independently.

## 5.4.2 Building Installations

Installations can be created in two ways: built locally by construction factories or transported from another colony.

### Local Construction

**Using Construction Factories:**
1. Open the colony's Economics tab
2. Select the installation type to build from the construction queue dropdown
3. Set the desired quantity
4. The colony's construction factories will begin producing the installation
5. Completed installations are automatically added to the colony

**Construction Rate:**
- Each factory has a base construction rate determined by technology
- Rate is measured in Build Points (BP) per year
- Each installation type has a BP cost
- Time to build = Installation BP Cost / (Number of Factories x BP per Factory per Year)
- More factories = faster construction

**Construction Priorities:**
- The construction queue is processed in order from top to bottom
- You can reorder queue items to prioritize urgent needs
- Multiple items can be queued simultaneously
- Construction splits evenly across all items at the same priority level (or in order, depending on settings)

**Mineral Requirements:**
- Each installation type requires specific minerals to build
- If minerals are unavailable, construction halts for that item
- Common mineral requirements:
  - Mines: Duranium, Mercassium
  - Construction Factories: Duranium, Tritanium
  - Infrastructure: Duranium
  - Research Labs: Duranium, various specialized minerals
  - Fuel Refineries: Duranium, Boronide

### Transport from Elsewhere

**Using Freighters:**
1. Build installations at an established colony (usually your homeworld)
2. Load installations onto freighters using the "Load Installation" order
3. Transport to the target colony
4. Unload installations using the "Unload Installation" order
5. Installations are immediately operational at the destination

**Advantages of Transport:**
- Faster than building locally if the destination lacks construction factories
- Can leverage the homeworld's superior industrial capacity
- Useful for bootstrapping new colonies quickly

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires freighter capacity and fuel
- Transit time can be significant for distant colonies
- Ties up transport ships that could be used for other purposes

### Mixed Strategy

The most efficient approach combines both methods:

1. **Initial Bootstrap:** Transport a batch of construction factories and mines from an established colony
2. **Local Growth:** Use the transported factories to build additional installations locally
3. **Supplement as Needed:** Continue transporting critical installations while local production ramps up
4. **Self-Sufficiency:** Eventually the colony can build everything it needs locally

> **Tip:** A colony needs approximately 20-30 construction factories to be reasonably self-sufficient for installation production. Below that, it's usually faster to transport installations from your homeworld. Above that, the colony can handle most of its own construction needs. The exact break-even depends on transit times and freighter availability.

## 5.4.3 Capacity and Limits

While there is no hard cap on the number of installations a colony can have, practical limitations determine the optimal size of your colony's industrial base.

### Population Limits

The most common constraint on installation count is population:

- Each installation (except automated mines) requires workers
- Total employment = Sum of all installations x workers per installation
- If employment exceeds population, installations operate at reduced efficiency
- Adding more installations past the staffing limit provides diminishing returns

**Practical Guideline:**
- 1 million population supports approximately 20 conventional mines or factories
- 10 million population supports approximately 200 installations
- Scale installations to match available workforce

### Mineral Availability

Installations are limited by the minerals available for construction and operation:

**Construction Minerals:**
- Building installations requires minerals from local deposits or imports
- If a colony runs out of Duranium, most construction halts
- Plan mineral imports for colonies with poor local deposits

**Operational Resources:**
- Fuel refineries need Sorium
- Ordnance factories need various minerals per missile design
- Fighter factories need minerals per fighter design
- Running out of input materials idles the installation

### Maintenance Considerations

All installations require some maintenance over time:

- Installations gradually degrade without maintenance
- Maintenance facilities provide maintenance supply points
- Insufficient maintenance leads to installation breakdown
- Replacement of failed installations costs additional construction time and minerals
- A general guideline: 1 maintenance facility per 20-30 installations

### Governor Bonuses and Efficiency

Governors assigned to colonies provide percentage bonuses to various activities:

- **Mining Bonus:** Increases per-mine output (effectively making fewer mines produce more)
- **Manufacturing Bonus:** Increases construction factory output
- **Research Bonus:** Increases research lab output
- **Population Growth Bonus:** Increases growth rate

These bonuses effectively increase the value of each installation, making it more efficient to have fewer boosted installations than many unboosted ones.

### Diminishing Returns Considerations

While individual installations don't suffer diminishing returns, the overall colony system can:

**Transport Bottleneck:**
- More mines produce more minerals, but if you can't ship them out, they just stockpile
- Plan transport capacity to match production

**Mineral Depletion:**
- High mining rates deplete deposits faster
- A 100-mine colony on a small asteroid will exhaust deposits quickly
- Match mining capacity to deposit size for longevity

**Research Limits:**
- Research labs are only useful up to the point your scientists can utilize them
- Each scientist has a maximum number of labs they can effectively manage
- Building 500 labs without enough scientists wastes capacity

### Optimal Colony Sizes by Purpose

**Mining Colony (Small Body):**
- 5-20 automated mines
- 1-2 mass drivers
- No population required
- Minimal investment, steady returns

**Mining Colony (Large Body):**
- 50-200 conventional mines
- 5-20 construction factories (for local maintenance)
- 2-5 mass drivers or regular freighter pickup
- 5-15 million population
- Infrastructure appropriate to colony cost

**Industrial Hub:**
- 100-500 construction factories
- 50-200 mines (for local minerals)
- 20-50 maintenance facilities
- Multiple shipyards
- 50-200 million population
- Major infrastructure investment

**Research Colony:**
- 50-200 research labs
- Minimal mining (import minerals)
- 10-50 million population
- Assign top scientists here
- Low colony cost world preferred (less infrastructure overhead)

**Fuel Production Colony:**
- 50-200 fuel harvesters (on gas giant) or fuel refineries (on Sorium-rich body)
- Fuel stockpile storage
- 5-30 million population (or automated if possible)
- Critical strategic installation -- protect it

> **Tip:** Don't try to make every colony do everything. Specialization is more efficient than generalization. A colony with 200 construction factories and 200 mines needs 20 million workers, but a colony with 200 factories and a separate colony with 200 mines each needs only 10 million -- and you can optimize each colony's conditions for its purpose.
