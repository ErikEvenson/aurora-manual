## 5.3.1 Colony Cost Factors

Colony cost is the comprehensive measure of how hostile a world is to human habitation. Understanding what drives colony cost allows you to make informed decisions about where to colonize and where to focus terraforming efforts.

### Temperature as a Cost Factor

Temperature is typically the single largest contributor to colony cost:

**How Temperature Affects Cost:**
- The ideal temperature range is 0C to 35C (no cost penalty)
- For every degree outside this range, colony cost increases
- The relationship is not linear -- extreme temperatures add progressively more cost per degree
- A world at -50C has a much higher temperature penalty than one at -10C

**Temperature Examples:**
| Surface Temperature | Approximate Cost Contribution |
|---|---|
| 15C (Earth-like) | 0.00 |
| -20C (Mars-like) | ~0.20-0.40 |
| -60C (Cold) | ~0.80-1.50 |
| -150C (Frozen) | ~3.00-5.00 |
| 80C (Hot) | ~1.00-2.00 |
| 200C+ (Infernal) | ~5.00+ |

### Atmospheric Composition as a Cost Factor

The atmosphere contributes to colony cost through multiple mechanisms:

**No Atmosphere:**
- Adds a base cost for enclosed habitation requirements
- Typically adds 0.5-1.0 to colony cost
- Relatively low because there's nothing actively hostile -- just the need for sealed buildings

**Wrong Pressure:**
- Too low (below 0.1 atm): adds cost similar to no atmosphere
- Too high (above 4 atm): adds increasing cost from pressure containment needs
- Moderate pressure (0.1-0.7 or 1.5-4.0): minor cost additions

**Toxic Gases:**
- Each toxic gas present adds to colony cost independently
- Highly toxic gases (F2, Cl2) add more per unit of partial pressure
- Multiple toxic gases compound the cost
- Even trace amounts of some gases trigger cost penalties

**Wrong Oxygen Level:**
- Too little O2 (below 0.1 atm partial pressure): breathable atmosphere absent
- Too much O2 (above 0.3 atm partial pressure): fire hazard and toxicity
- Either extreme adds moderate cost

### Gravity as a Cost Factor

Gravity contributes less to colony cost than temperature or atmosphere but is still significant:

- **Low Gravity (0.1-0.7g):** Modest cost increase. Health concerns and infrastructure adaptation.
- **Very Low Gravity (below 0.1g):** Higher cost increase. Microgravity habitation is challenging.
- **High Gravity (1.3-2.0g):** Moderate cost increase. Structural reinforcement needed.
- **Very High Gravity (above 2.0g):** Significant cost increase. Severe physiological stress.

Unlike temperature and atmosphere, gravity cannot be changed through terraforming. A high-gravity world will always have that cost component.

### Compound Colony Costs

Colony cost factors are additive. A world with multiple hostile characteristics has their penalties combined:

**Example Calculation:**
- Temperature: -80C = ~2.0 cost contribution
- Atmosphere: 0.3 atm with trace chlorine = ~1.5 cost contribution
- Gravity: 0.4g = ~0.3 cost contribution
- **Total Colony Cost: ~3.8**

This means approximately 380 infrastructure units per million colonists are needed.

> **Tip:** When evaluating colony targets, identify which factor dominates the colony cost. If it's temperature, terraforming via greenhouse gases may be practical. If it's toxic gases, terraforming installations can remove them. But if it's gravity -- you're stuck with that cost component permanently.

## 5.3.2 Habitability

Habitability is the qualitative assessment of how suitable a world is for human life without technological support. A fully habitable world requires no infrastructure, while a completely inhospitable one may be impractical to colonize at all.

### The Ideal Habitable World

A perfectly habitable world in Aurora C# has these characteristics:

- **Temperature:** 0-35C average surface temperature
- **Pressure:** 0.7-1.5 atm total atmospheric pressure
- **Oxygen:** 0.1-0.3 atm partial pressure of O2
- **Nitrogen:** Present as the primary atmospheric component
- **Gravity:** 0.7-1.3g surface gravity
- **Toxic Gases:** None present at any concentration
- **Hydrosphere:** Liquid water present (improves habitability aesthetically but is not strictly required for zero colony cost)

Finding such a world is rare. Most colonization targets deviate from the ideal in one or more ways.

### Habitability Spectrum

Worlds can be roughly categorized by their habitability:

**Tier 1 -- Naturally Habitable (Colony Cost 0.00):**
- Can sustain human life with no technological support
- Population can live and work outdoors
- Extremely rare in randomly generated systems
- Earth itself is the reference standard

**Tier 2 -- Nearly Habitable (Colony Cost 0.01-1.00):**
- Minor environmental challenges
- Might be slightly too cold, too warm, or have trace atmospheric issues
- Low infrastructure requirements
- Good candidates for terraforming to Tier 1

**Tier 3 -- Colonizable with Effort (Colony Cost 1.01-3.00):**
- Significant environmental challenges but manageable
- Require substantial infrastructure investment
- Most common colonization targets in practice
- Terraforming may reduce costs over decades

**Tier 4 -- Hostile (Colony Cost 3.01-6.00):**
- Severe environmental conditions
- Very high infrastructure requirements
- Only colonized for strategic resources or military necessity
- Long-term terraforming projects or automated mining preferred

**Tier 5 -- Extreme (Colony Cost 6.00+):**
- Nearly uninhabitable conditions
- Infrastructure requirements may be prohibitive
- Usually better served by automated mining installations
- Terraforming likely impractical on reasonable timescales

### Species Tolerance

Aurora C# allows different species (including your own after genetic modification research) to have different environmental tolerances:

- **Temperature Range:** Species can be adapted to wider or shifted temperature ranges
- **Pressure Tolerance:** Some species handle higher or lower pressures naturally
- **Gravity Tolerance:** Adaptation to different gravity ranges is possible
- **Gas Tolerance:** Modified species might tolerate gases that are toxic to baseline humans

These modifications effectively reduce colony cost for specific worlds by shifting what counts as "ideal" conditions for that population group.

> **Tip:** Don't wait for the perfect world. In most games, you'll colonize Tier 2-3 worlds for their mineral deposits or strategic positions, then terraform them over time while developing the colony. A Tier 3 world with excellent minerals is worth more than a Tier 1 world with nothing to mine.

## 5.3.3 Environmental Hazards

Beyond the static colony cost factors, several environmental conditions can actively threaten your colonies.

### Atmospheric Hazards

**Corrosive Atmospheres:**
- Atmospheres containing fluorine, chlorine, or sulfur compounds corrode infrastructure over time
- Increased maintenance requirements for all installations
- Can damage ships in orbit if concentration is extreme
- Terraforming to remove these gases eliminates the hazard

**Flammable Atmospheres:**
- Atmospheres with both oxygen and methane/hydrogen present a fire/explosion risk
- Industrial accidents become more common
- Colony safety systems require additional infrastructure

**Pressure Extremes:**
- Very high pressure (above 10 atm) can cause structural failures in habitation domes
- Sudden pressure loss in sealed environments is immediately fatal to exposed population
- Maintaining pressure seals requires ongoing infrastructure maintenance

### Radiation Hazards

**Sources of Radiation:**
- Stars with high UV output (O and B type stars)
- Planets within the radiation belts of gas giants (for moons)
- Worlds with weak or no magnetic fields
- Proximity to pulsars or other high-energy objects

**Effects:**
- Increased cancer rates (modeled as reduced population growth)
- Equipment degradation requiring more maintenance
- Colony cost increase from shielding requirements
- Ground forces deployed on high-radiation worlds may suffer attrition

### Geological Hazards

**Volcanism:**
- Geologically active worlds may experience volcanic events
- Can destroy installations
- Can alter atmospheric composition (adding SO2, CO2)
- More common on tidally-stressed moons

**Tectonic Activity:**
- Earthquakes can damage installations
- More relevant on larger, geologically active worlds
- Infrastructure designed for seismic zones costs more

### Temperature Extremes

**Extreme Cold:**
- Below -200C, even advanced materials become brittle
- Fuel can freeze in storage
- Power requirements for heating are enormous
- Found on outer-system bodies far from the star

**Extreme Heat:**
- Above 200C, standard construction materials fail
- Specialized heat-resistant infrastructure needed
- Electronic systems require extensive cooling
- Found on close-in planets or Venus-type worlds

### Mitigating Environmental Hazards

**Short-term Mitigation:**
- Build excess infrastructure to account for maintenance losses
- Station maintenance ships in orbit for emergency repairs
- Keep spare installations in reserve for rapid replacement
- Maintain stockpiles of construction materials

**Long-term Solutions:**
- Terraform to remove hazardous atmospheric components
- Adjust greenhouse gases to moderate temperature extremes
- Genetic modification of colonists for radiation resistance
- Relocate populations to safer worlds when possible

> **Tip:** Always check a world's atmospheric composition for corrosive or toxic gases before committing to a major colony. A world that looks good on paper (reasonable temperature, okay gravity) might have trace fluorine in its atmosphere that dramatically increases infrastructure maintenance costs. The Environmental tab in the colony view shows exactly which factors contribute to your colony cost.
