## 5.3.1 Colony Cost Factors

Colony cost is the comprehensive measure of how hostile a world is to human habitation. Understanding what drives colony cost allows you to make informed decisions about where to colonize and where to focus terraforming efforts.

### Temperature as a Cost Factor

Temperature is typically the single largest contributor to colony cost:

**How Temperature Affects Cost:**

- When surface temperature falls outside the species' tolerance range, the cost factor is: Degrees outside tolerance / (Species temperature range / 2)
- For tide-locked planets, the temperature cost is reduced to 20% of normal
- The formula means a species with a 35-degree tolerance range (e.g., 0C to 35C) gains 1.0 colony cost for every 17.5C outside that range

**Temperature Examples (assuming human baseline 0-35C tolerance):**
| Surface Temperature | Approximate Cost Factor |
|---|---|
| 15C (Earth-like) | 0.00 |
| -20C (Cold) | ~1.14 |
| -60C (Very Cold) | ~3.43 |
| -150C (Frozen) | ~8.57 |
| 80C (Hot) | ~2.57 |
| 200C+ (Infernal) | ~9.43+ |

### Atmospheric Composition as a Cost Factor

The atmosphere contributes to colony cost through several distinct mechanisms. Remember that in C# Aurora, only the highest single factor applies:

**Atmospheric Pressure:**

- If pressure exceeds species maximum tolerance: Cost = Pressure / Species Max, minimum 2.00
- Insufficient pressure (no breathable atmosphere): contributes through the Breathable Gas factor

**Breathable Gas (Oxygen for Humans):**

- A flat cost factor of 2.00 applies when breathable gas partial pressure is either too low for respiration or exceeds 30% of total atmospheric pressure
- This represents the need for sealed habitation with supplemental life support

**Dangerous Gases:**

- Various gases trigger cost factors of 2.00 or 3.00 depending on concentration thresholds
- Halogens (fluorine, chlorine): trigger at 1 ppm concentration
- Carbon dioxide: triggers at 5,000 ppm (0.5% of atmosphere) -- note that CO2 is classified as a dangerous gas in C# Aurora
- Other dangerous gases have their own concentration thresholds
- Only the single worst dangerous gas factor applies (they do not stack)

### Gravity as a Cost Factor

Gravity affects colonization in a binary manner in C# Aurora:

- **Below species minimum tolerance:** The body receives a flat colony cost of 1.00 and requires Low Gravity Infrastructure (designated "(LG)")
- **Above species maximum tolerance:** The body cannot be colonized at all
- **Within tolerance range:** No colony cost from gravity
- **Below 0.1g:** The body cannot retain atmosphere, preventing terraforming (but colonization with infrastructure is still possible)

Unlike temperature and atmosphere, gravity cannot be changed through terraforming.

### Hydrosphere as a Cost Factor

Water coverage below 20% adds a colony cost factor:

- **Formula:** (20 - Hydro Extent) / 10
- **At 0% water:** Cost factor of 2.0
- **At 10% water:** Cost factor of 1.0
- **At 20%+ water:** No cost from this factor

Water coverage can be increased through terraforming (adding water vapor to the atmosphere). Terraforming adds water at 0.1 atm per year, which adds 4% hydrosphere per year.

#### Hydrosphere Changes (v2.0)

In v1.13, hydrosphere state changes were instantaneous -- all surface water would immediately convert to vapor when conditions changed, or all vapor would condense at once. In v2.0, these transitions are gradual:

**Vapor Hydrosphere Changes:**

- Surface water on vapor-type planets now evaporates gradually at **4% hydro extent per year** rather than converting instantly
- This allows vapor worlds to retain some surface water during transitions

**Liquid Hydrosphere Conversions:**

- When planets transition from vapor to liquid types, existing atmospheric water follows terraforming rules with no immediate condensation of existing vapor
- Conversion happens at the standard terraforming rate

**Eccentric Orbit Benefits:**

- Planets with high orbital eccentricity maintain more stable hydrospheres under the new system
- Bodies spending most time in liquid zones retain water; those spending most time at high temperatures accumulate atmospheric water gradually
- This avoids extreme colony cost swings and makes eccentric orbit planets more manageable for terraforming projects

#### Water on Airless Bodies (v2.0)

In v1.13, bodies generated without atmosphere automatically had no water. This has changed in v2.0:

- Bodies without atmospheres now have a **20% chance** of generating an ice sheet, provided:
  1. Temperature is 223K or colder (equivalent to -50C)
  2. Gravity is at least 0.1G

- If an ice sheet is present, the hydro extent is generated normally through standard processes
- This creates more varied planetary environments and strategic considerations for colonizing frozen airless worlds

### Workforce Impact at High Colony Costs

At colony cost of 5.0 or higher, the available manufacturing workforce is progressively reduced. As population grows on very hostile worlds, the proportion of workers available for industrial production eventually drops to zero, as the entire workforce becomes occupied with life support and infrastructure maintenance. This makes high colony cost worlds impractical for industrial operations even if they have large populations.

### Colony Cost is Not Additive

Unlike some strategy games, C# Aurora's colony cost is determined by taking only the **single highest** factor from all environmental checks. A world with multiple problems still only uses the worst one for its colony cost. This means fixing the single worst factor about a world can dramatically reduce its colony cost, even if other problems remain.

**Example:**

- Temperature factor: 3.0 (very cold)
- Dangerous gas factor: 2.0 (trace chlorine)
- Hydrosphere factor: 1.5 (low water)
- **Final Colony Cost: 3.0** (only the worst applies)

Removing the temperature problem (e.g., via greenhouse gases) would drop the colony cost to 2.0 immediately.

> **Tip:** When evaluating colony targets, identify which factor dominates the colony cost. If it's temperature, terraforming via greenhouse gases may be practical. If it's toxic gases, terraforming installations can remove them. But if it's gravity -- you're stuck with that cost component permanently.

## 5.3.2 Habitability

Habitability is the qualitative assessment of how suitable a world is for human life without technological support. A fully habitable world requires no infrastructure, while a completely inhospitable one may be impractical to colonize at all.

### The Ideal Habitable World

A perfectly habitable world in Aurora C# has these characteristics:

- **Temperature:** 0-35C average surface temperature
- **Pressure:** 0.7-1.5 atm total atmospheric pressure
- **Oxygen:** 0.1-0.3 atm partial pressure of O2
- **Nitrogen:** Present as the primary atmospheric component
- **Gravity:** 0.7-1.3g surface gravity
- **Toxic Gases:** None present at any concentration
- **Hydrosphere:** Liquid water present (improves habitability aesthetically but is not strictly required for zero colony cost)

Finding such a world is rare. Most colonization targets deviate from the ideal in one or more ways.

### Habitability Spectrum

Worlds can be roughly categorized by their habitability:

**Tier 1 -- Naturally Habitable (Colony Cost 0.00):**

- Can sustain human life with no technological support
- Population can live and work outdoors
- Extremely rare in randomly generated systems
- Earth itself is the reference standard

**Tier 2 -- Nearly Habitable (Colony Cost 0.01-1.00):**

- Minor environmental challenges
- Might be slightly too cold, too warm, or have trace atmospheric issues
- Low infrastructure requirements
- Good candidates for terraforming to Tier 1

**Tier 3 -- Colonizable with Effort (Colony Cost 1.01-3.00):**

- Significant environmental challenges but manageable
- Require substantial infrastructure investment
- Most common colonization targets in practice
- Terraforming may reduce costs over decades

**Tier 4 -- Hostile (Colony Cost 3.01-6.00):**

- Severe environmental conditions
- Very high infrastructure requirements
- Only colonized for strategic resources or military necessity
- Long-term terraforming projects or automated mining preferred

**Tier 5 -- Extreme (Colony Cost 6.00+):**

- Nearly uninhabitable conditions
- Infrastructure requirements may be prohibitive
- Usually better served by automated mining installations
- Terraforming likely impractical on reasonable timescales

### Species Tolerance

Aurora C# allows different species (including your own after genetic modification research) to have different environmental tolerances:

- **Temperature Range:** Species can be adapted to wider or shifted temperature ranges
- **Pressure Tolerance:** Some species handle higher or lower pressures naturally
- **Gravity Tolerance:** Adaptation to different gravity ranges is possible
- **Gas Tolerance:** Modified species might tolerate gases that are toxic to baseline humans

These modifications effectively reduce colony cost for specific worlds by shifting what counts as "ideal" conditions for that population group.

> **Tip:** Don't wait for the perfect world. In most games, you'll colonize Tier 2-3 worlds for their mineral deposits or strategic positions, then terraform them over time while developing the colony. A Tier 3 world with excellent minerals is worth more than a Tier 1 world with nothing to mine.

## 5.3.3 Environmental Hazards

Beyond the static colony cost factors, several environmental conditions can actively threaten your colonies.

### Atmospheric Hazards

**Corrosive Atmospheres:**

- Atmospheres containing fluorine, chlorine, or sulfur compounds corrode infrastructure over time
- Increased maintenance requirements for all installations
- Can damage ships in orbit if concentration is extreme
- Terraforming to remove these gases eliminates the hazard

**Flammable Atmospheres:**

- Atmospheres with both oxygen and methane/hydrogen present a fire/explosion risk
- Industrial accidents become more common
- Colony safety systems require additional infrastructure

**Pressure Extremes:**

- Very high pressure (above 10 atm) can cause structural failures in habitation domes
- Sudden pressure loss in sealed environments is immediately fatal to exposed population
- Maintaining pressure seals requires ongoing infrastructure maintenance

### Radiation Hazards

**Sources of Radiation:**

- Stars with high UV output (O and B type stars)
- Planets within the radiation belts of gas giants (for moons)
- Worlds with weak or no magnetic fields
- Proximity to pulsars or other high-energy objects

**Effects:**

- Increased cancer rates (modeled as reduced population growth)
- Equipment degradation requiring more maintenance
- Colony cost increase from shielding requirements
- Ground forces (see [Section 13 Ground Forces](../13-ground-forces/)) deployed on high-radiation worlds may suffer attrition

### Geological Hazards

**Volcanism:**

- Geologically active worlds may experience volcanic events
- Can destroy installations
- Can alter atmospheric composition (adding SO2, CO2)
- More common on tidally-stressed moons

**Tectonic Activity:**

- Earthquakes can damage installations
- More relevant on larger, geologically active worlds
- Infrastructure designed for seismic zones costs more

### Temperature Extremes

**Extreme Cold:**

- Below -200C, even advanced materials become brittle
- Fuel can freeze in storage
- Power requirements for heating are enormous
- Found on outer-system bodies far from the star

**Extreme Heat:**

- Above 200C, standard construction materials fail
- Specialized heat-resistant infrastructure needed
- Electronic systems require extensive cooling
- Found on close-in planets or Venus-type worlds

### Mitigating Environmental Hazards

**Short-term Mitigation:**

- Build excess infrastructure to account for maintenance losses
- Station maintenance ships in orbit for emergency repairs
- Keep spare installations in reserve for rapid replacement
- Maintain stockpiles of construction materials

**Long-term Solutions:**

- Terraform to remove hazardous atmospheric components
- Adjust greenhouse gases to moderate temperature extremes
- Genetic modification of colonists for radiation resistance (see [Section 7.1 Technology Tree](../7-research/7.1-technology-tree.md))
- Relocate populations to safer worlds when possible

> **Tip:** Always check a world's atmospheric composition for corrosive or toxic gases before committing to a major colony. A world that looks good on paper (reasonable temperature, okay gravity) might have trace fluorine in its atmosphere that dramatically increases infrastructure maintenance costs. The Environmental tab in the colony view shows exactly which factors contribute to your colony cost.

## 5.3.4 Greenhouse Gases and Surface Temperature

Surface temperature in Aurora C# is calculated from a combination of base stellar heating, greenhouse effects, and anti-greenhouse (cooling) effects. Understanding these mechanics is essential for both evaluating colony targets and planning terraforming operations.

### Temperature Calculation Formula

The surface temperature of a body is determined by the following formula:

**Surface Temperature (K) = (Base Temperature (K) x Greenhouse Factor x Albedo) / Anti-Greenhouse Factor**

Where:

**Greenhouse Factor** = 1 + (Atmospheric Pressure / 10) + Pressure of Greenhouse Gases

- This factor is capped at a maximum of 3.0
- Greenhouse gases include: CO2, methane, water vapor, and other heat-trapping gases
- Higher atmospheric pressure provides a modest greenhouse contribution even without dedicated greenhouse gases

**Anti-Greenhouse Factor** = 1 + (Dust Level / 20,000) + Pressure of Anti-Greenhouse Gases

- This factor is capped at a maximum of 3.0
- Anti-greenhouse gases act as divisors, cooling the planet
- Dust functions mechanically as a temporary anti-greenhouse effect

**Base Temperature** is determined by the body's distance from its parent star and the star's luminosity.

### Greenhouse vs. Anti-Greenhouse Balance

The system treats anti-greenhouse effects as divisors rather than subtractive values. This design prevents temperatures from dropping below absolute zero (0 K) regardless of anti-greenhouse gas quantities, while still providing meaningful cooling effects.

- A Greenhouse Factor of 3.0 (maximum) triples the base temperature
- An Anti-Greenhouse Factor of 3.0 (maximum) reduces temperature to one-third
- Both at maximum would result in the original base temperature (3.0 / 3.0 = 1.0 multiplier)

### Dust Mechanics

Dust functions as a temporary anti-greenhouse effect within the temperature calculation:

- Dust reduces surface temperature by increasing the Anti-Greenhouse Factor
- Dust contribution: Dust Level / 20,000 added to the Anti-Greenhouse Factor
- **Terraforming equipment cannot remove dust** -- it dissipates naturally over time
- Dust can be introduced by various game events (asteroid impacts, volcanic activity)
- While dust is present, it may significantly cool a planet, potentially increasing colony cost from temperature

### Practical Implications

**For Cold Worlds:**

- Adding greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4) increases the Greenhouse Factor, warming the planet
- Maximum warming is 3x the base temperature (Greenhouse Factor cap of 3.0)
- If the base temperature is very low, even maximum greenhouse warming may be insufficient

**For Hot Worlds:**

- Adding anti-greenhouse gases cools the planet by increasing the divisor
- Maximum cooling is to 1/3 of the greenhouse-modified temperature
- Removing existing greenhouse gases also helps by reducing the Greenhouse Factor

**For Dust-Affected Worlds:**

- Dust cooling is temporary but can be significant
- Plan terraforming around dust events -- adding greenhouse gases while dust is present may be counterproductive
- Once dust clears, the planet will warm back to its pre-dust temperature

> **Tip:** When planning terraforming for a cold world, first calculate whether the maximum Greenhouse Factor of 3.0 can bring the surface temperature into the habitable range. If 3x the base temperature is still below 0C, no amount of greenhouse gas will make the world habitable through atmospheric modification alone. Focus your terraforming efforts on worlds where the math works out.

## 5.3.5 Earth Death Spiral

The Earth Death Spiral is a disaster scenario available during game setup (see Section 2.1) that creates an existential challenge requiring players to establish off-world colonies before Earth becomes uninhabitable.

### Mechanics

**Spiral Speed Options:** Players select from three rates of planetary degradation:

- 0.01 AU per year
- 0.02 AU per year
- 0.03 AU per year

**Environmental Changes:**
As Earth approaches the Sun, the game dynamically recalculates planetary conditions. Temperature, year length, and other environmental parameters shift progressively to reflect increasing proximity to the star.

**Destruction Threshold:**
When Earth moves within one million kilometres of the Sun, it is destroyed due to tidal stresses. Any remaining populations are also destroyed, leaving no survivors on the homeworld.

### Strategic Impact

This scenario fundamentally shifts Aurora's strategic focus from planetary management to interplanetary expansion and survival. Players must:

- Research and build colony ships rapidly
- Identify suitable colony targets early
- Transfer industrial capacity off-world before conditions deteriorate
- Balance current production needs against evacuation timelines

The speed option chosen determines how much time players have: at 0.03 AU/year, Earth's destruction occurs in roughly 50 years; at 0.01 AU/year, players have approximately 150 years.
