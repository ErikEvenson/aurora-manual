# 18.2 Time Increments

## 18.2.1 Increment Options

Aurora C# processes game events in discrete time increments. The player chooses the size of each increment, and the game advances by that amount of time with each press of the increment button. Available increments range from extremely short (for tactical combat) to very long (for peacetime development):

| Increment | Duration | Primary Use |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 5 seconds | 5s | Active combat, missile tracking |
| 30 seconds | 30s | Close-range combat maneuvering |
| 2 minutes | 120s | Pre-combat positioning |
| 5 minutes | 300s | Tactical movement, intercepts |
| 20 minutes | 1200s | Short-range fleet movement |
| 1 hour | 3600s | System transit |
| 3 hours | 10800s | Inner-system movement |
| 8 hours | 28800s | Cross-system transit |
| 1 day | 86400s | Fleet transit, construction |
| 5 days | 432000s | Routine operations |
| 30 days | 2592000s | Peacetime development |

### Automatic Interrupt

Regardless of the chosen increment, the game will interrupt (stop advancing time) when certain events occur:

- **Contact detected**: A new sensor contact appears
- **Missile launch detected**: Enemy missiles are detected in flight
- **Ship under fire**: Any of your ships takes damage
- **Fleet arrives at destination**: A fleet completes its movement orders
- **Construction complete**: A production queue item finishes
- **Research complete**: A technology finishes being researched
- **Geological survey complete**: A survey team finishes a body
- **Gravitational survey complete**: A jump point is discovered
- **Commander promotion/retirement**: Officer status changes
- **Fuel shortage**: A ship runs critically low on fuel
- **Maintenance failure**: A component breaks down on a ship

These interrupts ensure you never miss critical events even when using large time increments.

## 18.2.2 Sub-Pulse Processing

### What Happens Within an Increment

When you advance time by any increment, the game does not simply jump to the end state. Instead, it processes the increment in sub-pulses, with the sub-pulse length depending on the situation:

**Standard sub-pulse**: 5 seconds during active combat within sensor range. This means a 30-second increment during combat is processed as six 5-second sub-pulses, with movement, weapons fire, and damage resolution occurring at each sub-pulse.

**Movement sub-pulse**: For non-combat movement, ships are moved in intervals proportional to the increment size. Fleets in transit update their positions and check for sensor contacts at each sub-pulse boundary.

### Processing Order Within Each Sub-Pulse

1. **Movement**: All ships, missiles, and projectiles move simultaneously
2. **Sensor checks**: Passive and active sensors evaluate all objects for detection
3. **Fire control checks**: Weapons assigned to targets evaluate range and readiness
4. **Weapons fire**: Ready weapons discharge at assigned targets
5. **Point defense**: PD weapons engage incoming missiles and projectiles
6. **Damage resolution**: All pending damage is applied
7. **Status updates**: Fuel consumption, life support, morale, maintenance clocks advance
8. **Production**: Fractional production progress is accumulated (resolved meaningfully over longer periods)
9. **Population**: Growth, unrest, and environmental changes are calculated
10. **Event generation**: Random events, discoveries, and triggers are checked

### Missile Flight and Sub-Pulses

Missiles are tracked individually within sub-pulses. A missile with a speed of 32,000 km/s travels 160,000 km per 5-second sub-pulse. If a missile will reach its target within the current sub-pulse, the game calculates exact interception timing and resolves point defense fire at the appropriate moment.

Multi-stage missiles separate into submunitions at the correct range, with each submunition then tracked independently.

### Fleet Movement and Orders

During larger increments, fleets process their order queues:

- A fleet moving to a waypoint will arrive mid-increment if the distance allows, then begin its next order
- Conditional orders (e.g., "refuel at colony, then continue patrol") are evaluated and executed within the increment
- Multiple waypoint orders can complete within a single large increment

## 18.2.3 When to Use Each Increment

### 5 Seconds

Use during active missile combat or when you need frame-by-frame control:
- Missiles are inbound and you need to adjust PD assignments
- Micromanaging beam weapon targets during close engagements
- Ships are on collision courses and you need to adjust headings
- AMM volleys are in flight and you want to observe interception results

### 30 Seconds to 5 Minutes

Use during pre-combat and maneuvering phases:
- Closing with an enemy fleet but not yet in weapons range
- Positioning ships for an ambush at a jump point
- Managing multiple engagements in the same system
- Watching missile salvos cross large distances

### 20 Minutes to 3 Hours

Use for routine in-system operations:
- Surveying teams moving between bodies
- Freighters shuttling between colonies in the same system
- Fleet moving from orbit to a jump point within the system
- Fuel harvesters moving to gas giant orbits

### 8 Hours to 1 Day

Use for inter-system transit and moderate peacetime:
- Fleets transiting multiple jump points on established routes
- Waiting for a construction project that completes in a few days
- Colony ships traveling to nearby systems
- Survey fleets working through a system's bodies

### 5 Days to 30 Days

Use during extended peacetime development:
- Building up a colony's industrial base
- Waiting for research projects to complete
- Growing population on established worlds
- No known threats in sensor range

### Practical Tips

**Don't use 30-day increments if you have active exploration ships.** They may blunder into hostile territory and be destroyed before you can react. Use 1-day or 5-day increments when ships are in unexplored space.

**Drop to 5-second increments the instant combat starts.** The game will interrupt on first contact, but if you manually order an engagement, switch to 5-second increments before weapons fire begins.

**Use the Events window** to check what happened during large increments. After a 30-day advance, review the events log for anything that might need attention.

**Consider fleet speed when choosing increments.** If your fastest fleet moves 5,000 km/s and needs to cross 1 billion km, that takes roughly 200,000 seconds (about 2.3 days). Using 1-day increments will give you a check-in before arrival. Using 5-day increments will skip past the arrival, which is fine if there is no expected threat.

**During ground combat**, use 5-minute to 1-hour increments. Ground combat resolves in discrete phases, and you may want to adjust bombardment orders or landing priorities between phases.
