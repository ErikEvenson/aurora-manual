# 18.4 Late-Game Strategy

*Added: v2026.01.24*

## 18.4.1 Overview

The "late game" in Aurora C# typically begins when several conditions converge, usually around 60+ years into a campaign:

- **Multiple established colonies** (20+) with developed economies and specialized roles
- **Large navy** (100+ warships) requiring hierarchical organization and logistics chains
- **NPR encounters** -- five or more known alien races with varying diplomatic relationships
- **Spoiler presence** -- one or more spoiler races actively threatening your territory (see [Section 18.3 Spoiler Races](18.3-spoiler-races.md))
- **Technology maturity** -- core research trees substantially complete, with diminishing returns on further investment
- **Civilian economy** -- autonomous shipping and trade generating significant wealth (see [Section 6.5 Civilian Economy](../6-economy-and-industry/6.5-civilian-economy.md))

The late game presents qualitatively different challenges from the exploration and expansion phases. Problems are no longer about scarcity of resources or lack of capability, but about managing complexity, prioritizing across competing demands, and maintaining strategic coherence across a sprawling empire.

### 18.4.1.1 Late-Game Mindset Shift

| Phase | Primary Challenge | Bottleneck |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Early Game | Bootstrapping economy | Minerals, factories, population |
| Mid Game | Expansion and first contact | Ship production, logistics reach |
| Late Game | Complexity management | Attention, processing time, strategic coherence |

> **Tip:** The single most important late-game skill is knowing what to ignore. You cannot micromanage 25 colonies, 150 ships, and 6 diplomatic relationships simultaneously. Identify which situations require your direct attention and which can operate on standing orders or automation.

## 18.4.2 Multi-Empire Diplomacy

Managing five or more NPR relationships simultaneously requires a fundamentally different diplomatic approach than bilateral relations. Each NPR's actions affect how other NPRs perceive you and each other, creating a dynamic web of shifting alliances and rivalries.

### 18.4.2.1 Alliance Mechanics

Formal alliances (diplomatic points above +75 \hyperlink{ref-18.4-5}{[5]}; see [Section 15.1.5 Diplomatic Points](../15-diplomacy/15.1-alien-races.md)) provide significant benefits but carry obligations:

- **Allied status** generates 200 diplomatic points per year passively \hyperlink{ref-18.4-1}{[1]}
- Allied races share sensor contact data in systems where both have presence
- Allies may request military assistance against their own enemies
- Breaking an alliance (attacking an ally) inflicts severe diplomatic penalties with all known races, not just the target

### 18.4.2.2 Treaty Portfolio Management

With multiple NPRs, track treaties systematically:

| Treaty Type | Points/Year | Strategic Value | Risk |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|------|
| Trade Agreement | 100 | Economic growth, relationship maintenance | Minimal |
| Geological Survey | 100 | Intelligence on NPR territory | Reveals your survey capability |
| Gravitational Survey | 100 | Jump point data sharing | Reveals expansion routes |
| Research Treaty | 200 | Accelerated tech development | May level tech advantages |

Treaty point values sourced from AuroraWiki diplomacy documentation. \hyperlink{ref-18.4-2}{[2]}

> **Tip:** Research treaties are double-edged with technologically inferior NPRs. While they generate the most diplomatic points, they also accelerate the NPR's development relative to yours. Reserve research treaties for races you genuinely want to see grow stronger.

### 18.4.2.3 Intelligence Gathering at Scale

Late-game intelligence operations (see [Section 15.1.7 ELINT](../15-diplomacy/15.1-alien-races.md)) should be systematic:

- Station ELINT ships at every major NPR population you can access
- Maintain intelligence point accumulation above the 25% annual decay threshold
- Prioritize intelligence on NPRs with high Militancy scores -- these are the races most likely to attack
- Monitor NPR fleet movements near your territory boundaries for early warning of offensive preparations

### 18.4.2.4 Balancing Multiple Fronts

When managing relationships with five or more NPRs:

1. **Categorize each NPR** by threat level: existential threat, potential rival, neutral neighbor, or useful ally
2. **Concentrate diplomatic resources** on the most dangerous and most useful relationships
3. **Accept imperfect relations** with low-priority NPRs rather than spreading diplomatic ships too thin
4. **Avoid two-front wars** -- if conflict with one NPR is likely, ensure adjacent NPRs are at least neutral before committing
5. **Use buffer states** -- a weak NPR between you and a strong hostile one buys time and absorbs initial aggression

### 18.4.2.5 NPR-vs-NPR Conflicts

Late-game NPRs frequently engage each other. NPR-vs-NPR hostility is driven by the same diplomatic point system that governs player-NPR relations (see [Section 15.1 Alien Races](../15-diplomacy/15.1-alien-races.md)). When diplomatic points between two NPRs fall below the hostility threshold, they treat each other as hostile and may attack on contact. NPRs accumulate negative diplomatic points through territorial overlap, resource competition in shared systems, and the inherent Xenophobia/Militancy modifiers of their racial traits. Two high-Militancy NPRs sharing a border will almost inevitably come into conflict as negative modifiers compound faster than passive point generation can offset them.

These conflicts create opportunities:

- A distracted NPR is less likely to threaten you -- wars between your neighbors are generally favorable
- Salvage operations in the aftermath of NPR battles can yield technology insights (see [Section 18.1.4 Salvage Mechanics](18.1-game-mechanics.md))
- Offering trade agreements to a weakened post-war NPR builds cheap goodwill
- Monitor wreck detection events to track the progress of nearby conflicts

> **Note:** NPR hostility is not random. If two NPRs share jump point access to the same unclaimed systems, conflict is likely. You can sometimes predict which NPRs will fight each other by observing their expansion directions and racial Militancy scores via intelligence data.

## 18.4.3 Large Fleet Management

A navy exceeding 100 ships requires organizational discipline far beyond what works for a handful of task groups. The hierarchical fleet system (see [Section 9.4 Fleet Organization](../9-fleet-management/9.4-fleet-organization.md)) becomes essential rather than optional at this scale.

### 18.4.3.1 Organizational Template for Large Navies

```
Top-Level Admin Command
  |-- Home Command (Naval)
  |     |-- Home Fleet (capital defense)
  |     |-- Training Fleet
  |     |-- Reserve Fleet
  |
  |-- Strike Command (Naval)
  |     |-- 1st Strike Fleet (offensive operations)
  |     |-- 2nd Strike Fleet (secondary theater)
  |     |-- Carrier Battle Group
  |
  |-- Patrol Command (Patrol, 2x radius)
  |     |-- Sector A Patrol Fleet
  |     |-- Sector B Patrol Fleet
  |     |-- Frontier Patrol Fleet
  |
  |-- Survey Command (Survey, 2x radius)
  |     |-- Geological Survey Group
  |     |-- Gravitational Survey Group
  |
  |-- Logistics Command (Logistics)
        |-- Tanker Fleet
        |-- Transport Fleet
        |-- Tender Fleet
```

### 18.4.3.2 Fleet Hierarchies and Commander Bonuses

Admin Command bonuses compound through the hierarchy. A well-structured command chain with skilled commanders provides significant combat advantages:

- **Naval Commands** provide 25% of the commander's Crew Training, Reaction, Engineering, and Tactical bonuses to subordinate fleets \hyperlink{ref-18.4-3}{[3]}
- Nested commands multiply these bonuses -- a ship under two levels of Naval Commands receives compounded benefits
- Assign your highest-skilled admirals to top-level commands where their bonuses cascade to the most ships

### 18.4.3.3 Standing Order Chains for Autonomous Operations

With 100+ ships, you cannot issue individual orders to every fleet constantly. Standing orders (see [Section 9.5 Orders](../9-fleet-management/9.5-orders.md)) enable autonomous operation:

**Patrol Fleets:**
- Set patrol routes between key jump points
- Configure conditional orders to engage contacts below a tonnage threshold and flee from contacts above it
- Assign fuel thresholds that trigger automatic return to base for refueling

**Logistics Fleets:**
- Configure tanker routes between fuel production sites and forward bases
- Set transport cycles for mineral redistribution between colonies
- Automate colony supply runs with conditional loading/unloading at designated stops

**Defense Fleets:**
- Station at jump points with orders to engage hostiles
- Set retreat thresholds based on incoming fleet tonnage
- Configure rally points where multiple defense fleets concentrate when threatened

### 18.4.3.4 Sub-Fleet Specialization

Within a parent fleet, sub-fleets allow tactical flexibility without losing strategic cohesion:

| Sub-Fleet Role | Composition | Purpose |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Missile Screen | Missile destroyers/cruisers | Long-range alpha strikes |
| Beam Line | Beam cruisers/battlecruisers | Close engagement firepower |
| Point Defense | PD frigates/destroyers | Protect high-value units from missiles |
| Scout Element | Fast sensor frigates | Forward detection and targeting data |
| Logistics Train | Tanker, tender, supply | Sustain extended operations |

### 18.4.3.5 Escort Configurations

Carrier battle groups and high-value fleet elements require dedicated escort configurations:

- **Inner screen**: PD-equipped destroyers within 50,000 km providing close-in missile defense
- **Outer screen**: Sensor-heavy frigates at maximum detection range providing early warning
- **Strike group**: Missile platforms positioned for coordinated salvo fire
- **Reserve**: Fast beam ships held back to exploit opportunities or cover retreats

> **Tip:** Resist the temptation to combine all your ships into one massive fleet. A single 150-ship fleet is unwieldy to manage, moves at the speed of its slowest ship, and cannot respond to threats in multiple systems simultaneously. Five 30-ship fleets provide far more strategic flexibility.

## 18.4.4 Industrial Optimization

Managing 20+ colonies requires shifting from hands-on construction queue management to establishing specialized production networks with automated supply chains.

### 18.4.4.1 Colony Specialization

Late-game colonies should have clear roles rather than attempting self-sufficiency:

| Specialization | Key Installations | Colony Characteristics |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Research World | Research labs, Ancient Constructs | High population, skilled scientists |
| Shipyard World | Naval/commercial yards, ordnance factories | Mineral-rich or well-supplied, governor with Manufacturing bonus |
| Mining World | Automated mines, mass drivers | High-accessibility mineral deposits |
| Fuel World | Refineries, fuel harvesters (orbital) | Sorium deposits or gas giant proximity |
| Population Hub | Infrastructure, financial centres | Ideal atmosphere, high growth rate |
| Forward Base | Maintenance facilities, repair yards | Strategic jump point location |

### 18.4.4.2 Supply Chain Optimization

Efficient late-game logistics connect specialized colonies through mineral and component flows:

1. **Mining worlds** extract raw minerals and mass-drive them to shipyard worlds (see [Section 6.2 Mining](../6-economy-and-industry/6.2-mining.md))
2. **Shipyard worlds** receive minerals and produce ships, installations, and ordnance
3. **Fuel worlds** produce and distribute fuel through tanker routes to forward bases
4. **Population hubs** grow colonists for export to new or expanding colonies

**Mass Driver Networks:**
- Mass drivers transfer minerals between colonies within the same system at zero fuel cost
- For inter-system mineral transfer, dedicated freighter routes are more efficient than maintaining excess mines at every location
- Prioritize mass driver installation on high-output mining worlds to eliminate freighter bottleneck

### 18.4.4.3 Civilian Economy Scaling

By the late game, the civilian economy (see [Section 6.5 Civilian Economy](../6-economy-and-industry/6.5-civilian-economy.md)) should handle routine logistics:

- Civilian shipping lines automatically transport cargo between colonies with demand
- Financial centres generate wealth proportional to population, funding naval construction
- Civilian mining ships exploit deposits you have surveyed but not formally colonized
- Allow civilian fuel harvesters to supplement military fuel production

> **Tip:** The most common late-game economic mistake is continuing to micromanage mineral transport that civilian freighters could handle automatically. Once a route is established with sufficient population at both ends, civilian shipping will service it. Reserve your military transports for forward deployments and emergency resupply.

### 18.4.4.4 Industrial Expansion Priorities

When your core economy is mature, prioritize:

1. **Shipyard capacity** -- add slipways and expand tonnage limits rather than building new yards
2. **Research labs** on Ancient Construct worlds for maximum bonus stacking
3. **Ordnance factories** -- missile expenditure in late-game battles can be enormous
4. **Maintenance facilities** at forward bases to sustain distant fleet operations (see [Section 14.2 Maintenance](../14-logistics/14.2-maintenance.md))

### 18.4.4.5 Mineral Depletion and Transition Planning

By the late game, core homeworld mineral deposits will begin to exhaust or approach exhaustion. This is a predictable crisis that should be anticipated decades in advance rather than addressed reactively (see [Section 6.1.3 Depletion](../6-economy-and-industry/6.1-minerals.md) for depletion mechanics).

**When Core Deposits Exhaust:**

When a homeworld deposit reaches zero, mining of that mineral stops immediately. Mines remain in place but produce nothing for the exhausted mineral. If your shipyards and ordnance factories depend on homeworld mineral stockpiles, production queues stall without warning. The solution is never to let this happen by surprise -- monitor your depletion timeline estimates regularly.

**Transitioning to Remote Mining Infrastructure:**

As homeworld deposits decline, shift extraction to remote mining colonies connected by supply networks:

1. **Mass driver networks** -- install mass drivers on remote mining worlds and a receiving mass driver on your industrial hub. Minerals transfer at zero fuel cost within the same system. This is the most efficient option for intra-system mineral transfer.
2. **Freighter networks** -- for inter-system mining colonies, establish dedicated freighter routes. Civilian shipping lines will also service these routes once populations are established at both ends (see [Section 6.5 Civilian Economy](../6-economy-and-industry/6.5-civilian-economy.md)).
3. **Forward stockpiling** -- maintain mineral reserves at shipyard worlds sufficient for 5-10 years of production, so that a supply interruption does not immediately halt construction.

**Conventional Mines vs. Automated Mines:**

The decision between conventional and automated mines depends on colony population and accessibility:

- **Conventional mines** produce more per unit but require population to operate (one mine per 50,000 workers) \hyperlink{ref-18.4-4}{[4]}
- **Automated mines** produce less per unit but require zero population, making them ideal for hostile-environment bodies, asteroids, or remote locations where colonists are impractical
- **Transition point**: shift to automated mines when a body has low population potential (no breathable atmosphere, extreme temperature, or simply too far from population hubs to justify colonization)
- Automated mines are also preferable on deposits with accessibility below 0.3, where the sheer number of mines required makes population support impractical

> **Tip:** A common late-game pattern is to run conventional mines on your homeworld and nearby habitable colonies while deploying automated mines on every marginally useful asteroid and airless moon in your empire. The combined output of twenty automated mining sites can replace a single exhausted homeworld deposit.

**Asteroid Mining:**

Asteroids frequently carry high-accessibility mineral deposits that make them attractive late-game mining sites despite their small total quantities:

- Many asteroids have accessibility 0.7-1.0, yielding excellent per-mine output
- Automated mines are the standard approach since asteroids cannot support large populations
- Mass drivers on asteroids can feed minerals directly to your main industrial colony within the same system
- Geological surveys of asteroid belts often reveal deposits of minerals scarce elsewhere in your empire

**Deposit Monitoring and Timeline:**

Maintain awareness of your mineral depletion trajectory:

1. Check the Economics window mineral deposits every 5-10 game years to track remaining quantities
2. Calculate years remaining using: `Deposit quantity / (Mines x per-mine output x accessibility)`
3. Begin developing replacement mining infrastructure when a critical deposit has fewer than 20 years remaining
4. Prioritize replacement for Duranium, Gallicite, and whichever minerals your current shipbuilding programs consume fastest

> **Warning:** The most dangerous depletion scenario is Gallicite exhaustion with no replacement source. Without Gallicite, you cannot build engines, and without engines, you cannot build ships or colony transports to reach new deposits. Always maintain a Gallicite reserve and develop secondary sources early.

## 18.4.5 Technology Endgame

When core technology trees are substantially researched, strategic decisions about remaining investment become critical. Not all late-game research provides equal returns.

### 18.4.5.1 Diminishing Returns

Most technology trees exhibit diminishing returns at high levels:

| Technology Area | High-Value Threshold | Notes |
|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| Engine Power/Fuel Efficiency | 80% of max | Beyond this, gains are marginal per RP invested |
| Beam Weapon Damage | Top 2-3 tiers | Maximum damage weapons are worth the investment |
| Missile Agility/Speed | Top 3 tiers | Critical for late-game anti-ship effectiveness |
| Armor Strength | Top 2 tiers | Weight savings compound on large ships |
| Sensor Range | 90% of max | Detection range is always valuable but increasingly expensive |

### 18.4.5.2 Priority Late-Game Research

When core trees are complete, invest in these areas:

**High Priority:**
- **Construction Rate** -- accelerates all ground production; compounds across all colonies
- **Shipyard Operations** -- faster ship construction; multiplied by number of slipways
- **Mining Production** -- increases output from existing mines empire-wide
- **Jump Engine Efficiency** -- enables larger ships to transit more efficiently

**Medium Priority:**
- **Shield regeneration** -- incremental improvement to sustained combat survivability
- **Magazine capacity** -- more ordnance per magazine component reduces magazine vulnerability
- **ECM/ECCM** -- each level provides significant combat advantage (see [Section 12.5 Electronic Warfare](../12-combat/12.5-electronic-warfare.md))

**Niche/Exotic:**
- **Cloaking technology** -- high cost but enables entirely new tactical approaches (see [Section 11.4 Stealth](../11-sensors-and-detection/11.4-stealth.md))
- **Meson weapons** -- bypass armor entirely; situationally devastating
- **Area-effect warheads** -- specialized anti-swarm capability

### 18.4.5.3 Tech Advantages vs NPRs

NPR technology scales with game time using the formula: Tech Years = Game Years + 20, Research Points = Labs x Tech Years x 300 *(unverified — #745 -- requires live testing)* (see [Section 15.1.2 NPR Behavior](../15-diplomacy/15.1-alien-races.md)). This means:

- Early-game tech advantages erode over time as NPRs catch up
- Late-game NPRs may approach or exceed player tech levels unless the player maintains active research
- Specific tech advantages (e.g., ECM levels, engine efficiency) matter more than general tech level
- Focus research on areas where a one-level advantage provides disproportionate combat benefit

> **Tip:** Never stop researching, even when your tech trees feel "complete." NPRs research continuously and will eventually match you in areas you neglect. A 2-level ECM advantage or a generation-ahead missile engine can be the difference between a clean victory and a pyrrhic one.

## 18.4.6 Spoiler Escalation

The most dangerous late-game scenarios occur when multiple spoiler types are active simultaneously. Each spoiler compounds the threat of the others by dividing your attention and military resources.

### 18.4.6.1 Threat Compounding

When multiple spoilers are active, their effects interact:

| Combination | Compound Effect |
|------------|----------------|
| Swarm + Raiders | Raiders hit supply lines while Swarm demands fleet commitment at the front |
| Invaders + Swarm | Aether Rifts may form in systems you need to transit for Swarm operations |
| Raiders + Invaders | Raider attacks on construct worlds delay Rift mitigation |
| All Three | Existential crisis requiring perfect resource allocation |

### 18.4.6.2 Prioritizing Responses

When multiple threats demand simultaneous response:

1. **Aether Rifts near inhabited systems** -- immediate colony evacuation priority; radiation damage is irreversible (see [Section 18.3.6 Aether Rifts](18.3-spoiler-races.md))
2. **Swarm expansion toward core territory** -- exponential growth makes delay catastrophic; engage before forces double
3. **Raider attacks on logistics** -- disrupts all other operations; assign dedicated fast-response groups
4. **Precursor territory** -- static threat; can be deferred until other situations stabilize
5. **Rakhas worlds** -- no urgency unless you need their minerals immediately

### 18.4.6.3 Balancing Defensive and Offensive Postures

Late-game force allocation requires balancing:

**Defensive Requirements:**
- Jump point defense stations at all entry points to core systems
- PD-equipped pickets along known Raider approach vectors
- Ground forces on construct worlds to prevent Raider ground assault
- Sensor coverage across all colonized systems

**Offensive Requirements:**
- Strike fleets for Swarm queen elimination operations
- Missile-heavy task forces for Precursor system assault
- Fast interceptors for Raider pursuit and destruction
- Survey and xenoarchaeology teams for new Ancient Construct discovery

A general guideline: maintain 60% of naval tonnage available for offensive operations and 40% committed to defensive positions. If defensive commitments exceed 50%, you are losing strategic initiative.

### 18.4.6.4 Ancient Construct Race Against Aether Rifts

When Invaders are active, the late game becomes a race between two timelines:

**Rift Timeline:**
- Rifts grow each construction phase: `(Phase Length / Year Length) x 10%`
- New rifts appear with increasing probability over time
- Raiding forces emerging from rifts scale with rift size
- Stabilization vessels can open new rifts in additional systems

**Construct Timeline:**
- Each activated construct contributes its racial bonus (10% of local bonus) toward the 100% threshold
- Constructs require xenoarchaeological survey AND 1 million+ population to activate
- New construct worlds must be discovered through geological surveys
- Colony establishment and population growth take years

**Winning the Race:**
- Prioritize xenoarchaeological survey ships above all other survey types
- Fast-track colony ships to construct worlds -- even small colonies eventually reach 1 million
- Destroy rift stabilization vessels before they spread rifts to new systems
- A single high-percentage construct (e.g., 60%) provides +6% racial bonus -- find the big ones first
- When combined racial bonuses exceed 100%, rifts shrink and new formation is suppressed

> **Tip:** Track your Ancient Construct racial bonus total in the Economics window's Constructs tab. Know exactly how far you are from the 100% threshold and calculate how many additional constructs you need. Every construct you activate before a rift reaches an inhabited world saves potentially millions of colonists.

## 18.4.7 Performance Management

As empire complexity grows, Aurora C#'s turn processing time increases significantly. Understanding what drives processing cost helps you keep the game playable.

### 18.4.7.1 What Impacts Processing Time

| Factor | Impact | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| NPR Count | High | Each NPR runs full AI decision-making each increment |
| Total Ships (all races) | High | Movement, sensor checks, maintenance calculations per ship |
| Colony Count (all races) | Medium | Production queues, population growth, mining per colony |
| Active Missile Salvos | High | Each salvo checks tracking, PD intercept, movement each pulse |
| Aether Rift Count | Medium | Growth calculations, radiation checks, raiding force generation |
| System Count | Low-Medium | More systems = more potential activity locations |

### 18.4.7.2 Time Increment Strategy

The choice of time increment (see [Section 18.2 Time Increments](18.2-time-increments.md)) directly affects playability:

- **5-day increments** process fastest but may miss short-duration events
- **1-day increments** provide good resolution for peacetime management
- **Combat** automatically drops to 5-second or 30-second pulses regardless of your increment choice
- **Sub-pulse processing** is where most performance cost occurs -- avoid leaving fleets on intercept courses that generate constant sub-pulse resolution

### 18.4.7.3 Approximate Performance Thresholds

The following thresholds are approximate values reported by the community. Individual results vary with hardware, game settings, and specific empire configurations, but they provide useful planning guidelines:

| Factor | Threshold | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Active missile salvos | >500 | Processing time per pulse increases noticeably; missile-heavy battles can stall turn resolution |
| Patrol groups | <3-5 ships per group | Overhead of many small groups exceeds benefit; consolidate into fewer groups |
| Colony count (all races) | 50+ | Production queue and population calculations begin to add measurable delay |
| Simultaneously moving ships | 200+ | Movement and sensor recalculations compound; each additional ship adds incremental cost |

> **Note:** These thresholds are approximate and based on community experience across various hardware configurations. Your specific performance breakpoints may differ, but these values serve as reasonable planning targets for when to start applying optimization strategies.

### 18.4.7.4 Strategies to Keep Turns Manageable

**Reduce NPR processing load:**
- In game setup, limit total NPR count if performance is a priority
- NPRs that have been defeated (no colonies, no ships) are removed from processing
- The Minimum Player Systems settings delay spoiler activation, giving you gameplay before processing load increases

**Reduce fleet processing load:**
- Consolidate small patrol groups into fewer, larger fleets
- Use standing orders rather than micromanaged waypoint chains (fewer order recalculations)
- Scrap obsolete ships rather than keeping them in reserve (each ship incurs per-increment cost)
- Delete stray missile salvos via the Missile Salvos tab (see [Section 9.4.12 Missile Salvos Tab](../9-fleet-management/9.4-fleet-organization.md))

**Reduce colony processing load:**
- Abandon marginal colonies that produce little value
- Consolidate mining operations to fewer, richer deposits
- Use mass drivers instead of freighter routes where possible (fewer ship movements)

**Combat-specific optimizations:**
- Resolve battles decisively rather than conducting drawn-out skirmishes that maintain combat pulse processing
- Avoid long missile chases -- if a salvo will not catch its target, delete it
- Disengage from fights you cannot win quickly; the processing cost of a stalemate exceeds the cost of retreating and returning with overwhelming force

> **Tip:** If your game is processing slowly, check the Missile Salvos tab first. Hundreds of missiles chasing targets they will never reach is one of the most common causes of late-game slowdown. A quick cleanup can dramatically improve turn speed.

### 18.4.7.5 When to Accept Slower Processing

Some processing costs are worth accepting:

- Aether Rift calculations are unavoidable when Invaders are active -- the threat justifies the cost
- Large NPR navies mean the galaxy is alive and dangerous -- a sterile, fast-processing galaxy is less interesting
- Combat pulses during major battles are necessarily slow -- save before major engagements and be patient
