# 18.3 Spoiler Races

## 18.3.1 Overview

> **SPOILER WARNING**: This section reveals details about the non-player threats in Aurora C#. If you prefer to discover these organically during gameplay, skip this section entirely. Knowledge of spoiler races significantly changes how you approach exploration and military preparation.

Spoiler races are pre-programmed alien threats that exist in the galaxy independently of procedurally generated Non-Player Races (NPRs). Unlike NPRs, which are conventional civilizations with diplomacy options and similar technology progression, spoiler races are designed as existential threats with unique mechanics, fixed behaviors, and no diplomacy options.

### Key Characteristics

- **No diplomacy**: You cannot negotiate with spoiler races. They are universally hostile.
- **Pre-designed fleets**: Their ships and weapons are hand-crafted, not generated by the same rules as player ships (though they follow the same physics for combat resolution).
- **Scaled to challenge**: Spoiler races are designed to test even well-developed empires. Encountering them early is often fatal.
- **Triggered by exploration**: Most spoiler races are encountered by exploring specific systems or jump point chains. The further you explore, the more likely you are to find them.
- **Game creation options**: At game start, you can enable or disable individual spoiler race types, and adjust their difficulty scaling.

### When You Encounter Them

Spoiler races typically guard specific systems or roam particular regions. Signs that you are approaching spoiler territory include:

- Unusual system compositions (very high or very low mineral content)
- Systems with no apparent natural jump points leading further (dead ends)
- Wrecks or ruins with technology far beyond your current level
- Sensor contacts with signatures unlike any known NPR design

## 18.3.2 Swarm

The Swarm is an insectoid/biological threat that overwhelms opponents through sheer numbers. They are one of the most common spoiler encounters and represent a direct military challenge.

### Characteristics

- **Numbers over quality**: Swarm ships tend to be individually weaker than player designs of equivalent technology, but appear in vastly larger numbers.
- **Regeneration**: Swarm fleets grow over time. If you encounter a Swarm system and retreat without destroying them, their forces will be larger when you return.
- **Expansion**: Left unchecked, the Swarm will eventually expand through jump points toward player territory. They do not stop at system borders.
- **No negotiation**: The Swarm does not communicate and cannot be reasoned with.
- **Biological technology**: Their ships use organic equivalents of standard TN technology, but combat resolution works identically.

### Fleet Composition

Typical Swarm fleets consist of:

- **Scouts**: Small, fast vessels that probe jump points and detect intruders
- **Warriors**: Medium-sized combat vessels with short-range beam weapons and moderate armor
- **Queens**: Large capital ships that serve as production centers; destroying queens slows Swarm regeneration
- **Swarmlings**: Very small, numerous craft that overwhelm point defense through volume of attacks

### Strategies Against the Swarm

**Missile doctrine works well**: The Swarm's large fleet counts mean your missiles always have targets, and their individual ships are fragile enough that standard warheads are effective.

**Chokepoint defense**: If the Swarm is contained to one or two jump points, fortify those jump points with bases carrying large missile magazines and beam PD. The Swarm's expansion is physical and must pass through jump points.

**Destroy queens first**: Queens are the priority target. Without queens, Swarm regeneration slows dramatically. Focus fire on the largest Swarm vessels.

**Don't wait**: The Swarm grows exponentially. A manageable threat in 2050 becomes an unstoppable wave by 2070 if left alone. Engage as soon as you have sufficient forces.

**Expect attrition**: You will lose ships against the Swarm. Design expendable missile platforms and accept losses in exchange for kills on queens.

## 18.3.3 Precursors

Precursors represent an ancient, technologically superior civilization. Unlike the Swarm, they do not expand aggressively, but their defenses are formidable and their territory often contains extremely valuable resources or technology.

### Characteristics

- **Technological superiority**: Precursor weapons and defenses are significantly more advanced than equivalent player technology. Their beam weapons have longer range, their missiles are faster, and their armor is thicker.
- **Static defense**: Precursors typically do not expand from their home systems. They defend their territory but rarely pursue retreating fleets beyond their borders.
- **Ruins and salvage**: Precursor systems often contain ruins on planets that can be explored for technology bonuses, and destroyed Precursor ships can sometimes be salvaged for research insights.
- **Limited numbers**: Unlike the Swarm, Precursor fleets are small but individually powerful. Each ship is a formidable opponent.
- **No regeneration**: Precursor losses are permanent. They do not rebuild destroyed ships (in most configurations).

### Fleet Composition

Typical Precursor forces include:

- **Guardians**: Extremely well-armed and armored capital ships with advanced beam weapons. A single Guardian can destroy several player battlecruisers.
- **Sentinels**: Medium escorts with strong point defense and ECM, making missile attacks difficult.
- **Watchers**: Sensor platforms with very long-range detection capabilities. They will spot your fleet long before you detect them.
- **Orbital stations**: Fixed defensive platforms around key planets, bristling with weapons.

### Strategies Against Precursors

**Overwhelming missile volleys**: Precursor PD is strong but not infinite. Massive coordinated salvos can saturate their defenses. Design missiles for maximum salvo size.

**Long-range engagement**: Do not close to beam range unless absolutely necessary. Precursor beam weapons outrange most player equivalents. Stay at maximum missile range and wear them down.

**ECM investment**: High-level ECM on your ships reduces Precursor beam accuracy significantly. Their weapons are powerful but follow the same to-hit rules.

**Attrition warfare**: If Precursors do not regenerate in your game settings, you can whittle them down over multiple engagements. Retreat when losses become unacceptable, resupply, and return.

**Scout first**: Use small, fast sensor ships to map Precursor fleet positions before committing your battle fleet. Know what you are facing before engaging.

**Salvage opportunity**: Destroyed Precursor ships may provide research bonuses. Winning a Precursor engagement can accelerate your technology significantly.

## 18.3.4 Others

Several additional spoiler race types exist in Aurora C#, each presenting unique challenges:

### Star Swallowers

An extremely rare and catastrophic threat. Star Swallowers are planet-sized entities that consume stars, destroying entire systems.

- **Detection**: Approaching Star Swallowers can be detected by unusual gravitational readings in neighboring systems.
- **Engagement**: Conventional weapons are ineffective. Star Swallowers require specialized approaches or may simply be threats you must evacuate ahead of.
- **Consequence**: If a Star Swallower reaches a system, all bodies and colonies in that system are destroyed. Permanent loss.
- **Strategy**: Early detection through extensive survey networks is essential. Evacuation of threatened systems is the only reliable response for most empires.

### Raiders

Pirate-like factions that target shipping lanes and lightly defended colonies.

- **Hit and run**: Raiders attack vulnerable targets and retreat before heavy defenses can respond.
- **Target selection**: They prefer freighters, colony ships, and undefended mining colonies.
- **Escalation**: Raider strength may increase over time if not suppressed.
- **Strategy**: Escort freighters through dangerous space, station patrol fleets at key jump points, and hunt Raider bases when located.

### Invaders

Conventional military threats from beyond explored space that launch coordinated assaults on player territory.

- **Organized military**: Unlike the Swarm's mindless expansion, Invaders use tactical coordination, combined arms, and strategic targeting.
- **Diplomacy impossible**: Despite appearing conventionally organized, Invaders cannot be negotiated with.
- **Waves**: Invaders typically attack in waves of increasing strength, giving the player time to prepare between assaults.
- **Strategy**: Treat them as a conventional military opponent. Invest in early warning sensors, fortify chokepoints, and maintain a strategic reserve fleet.

### Guardians (System Guardians)

Ancient automated defenses that protect specific systems, distinct from Precursor forces.

- **Triggered by entry**: Guardians activate only when a player ship enters their protected system.
- **Fixed position**: They do not pursue beyond their system borders.
- **Extremely powerful**: Individual Guardian platforms can be stronger than Precursor Guardians.
- **Worth the effort**: Systems protected by Guardians often contain extraordinarily rich mineral deposits or valuable alien ruins.
- **Strategy**: Approach with overwhelming force or not at all. Hit-and-run tactics are risky since Guardians often have excellent sensors.

### Game Creation Settings

When starting a new game, you can configure:

- **Which spoiler types are enabled**: Toggle each type on or off individually.
- **Difficulty scaling**: Adjust the strength of spoiler forces from minimal to extreme.
- **Distance from Sol**: Control how far from the starting system spoiler races can appear. Greater distance gives more preparation time but also means more infrastructure to defend.
- **Spoiler density**: How many spoiler instances can exist simultaneously in the galaxy.

### General Preparation Advice

Regardless of which spoiler races are enabled:

1. **Never explore without a plan**: Have military forces ready before pushing into unknown space.
2. **Maintain a strategic reserve**: Keep a fleet in reserve that is not committed to any border, ready to respond to new threats.
3. **Invest in sensors**: Long-range detection gives you time to react. Sensor bases at key jump points provide early warning.
4. **Research military technology continuously**: Do not neglect weapons and defense research during peacetime. The next threat may appear without warning.
5. **Diversify your forces**: Different spoiler types require different approaches. A fleet optimized for one threat may be vulnerable to another.
