# 18.3 Spoiler Races

## 18.3.1 Overview

> **Warning:** This section reveals details about the non-player threats in Aurora C#. If you prefer to discover these organically during gameplay, skip this section entirely. Knowledge of spoiler races significantly changes how you approach exploration and military preparation.

Spoiler races are pre-programmed alien threats that exist in the galaxy independently of procedurally generated Non-Player Races (NPRs). Unlike NPRs, which are conventional civilizations with diplomacy options and similar technology progression, spoiler races are designed as existential threats with unique mechanics, fixed behaviors, and no diplomacy options.

### Key Characteristics

- **No diplomacy**: You cannot negotiate with spoiler races. They are universally hostile.
- **Pre-designed fleets**: Their ships and weapons are hand-crafted, not generated by the same rules as player ships (though they follow the same physics for combat resolution).
- **Scaled to challenge**: Spoiler races are designed to test even well-developed empires. Encountering them early is often fatal.
- **Triggered by exploration**: Most spoiler races are encountered by exploring specific systems or jump point chains (see [Section 17.2 Gravitational Survey](../17-exploration/17.2-gravitational-survey.md)). The further you explore, the more likely you are to find them.
- **Game creation options**: At game start, you can enable or disable individual spoiler race types, and adjust their difficulty scaling.

### When You Encounter Them

Spoiler races typically guard specific systems or roam particular regions. Signs that you are approaching spoiler territory include:

- Unusual system compositions (very high or very low mineral content)
- Systems with no apparent natural jump points leading further (dead ends)
- Wrecks or ruins with technology far beyond your current level
- Sensor contacts with signatures unlike any known NPR design

## 18.3.2 Swarm

The Swarm is an insectoid/biological threat that overwhelms opponents through sheer numbers. They are one of the most common spoiler encounters and represent a direct military challenge.

### Characteristics

- **Numbers over quality**: Swarm ships tend to be individually weaker than player designs of equivalent technology, but appear in vastly larger numbers.
- **Regeneration**: Swarm fleets grow over time. If you encounter a Swarm system and retreat without destroying them, their forces will be larger when you return.
- **Fleet Size Variation (v2.1.1)**: Swarm fleet sizes have a wider range and are less affected by elapsed time than in earlier versions. This produces generally smaller early-game fleets with occasional larger ones, and more frequent large fleets in later stages of the game.
- **Expansion**: Left unchecked, the Swarm will eventually expand through jump points toward player territory. They do not stop at system borders.
- **No negotiation**: The Swarm does not communicate and cannot be reasoned with.
- **Biological technology**: Their ships use organic equivalents of standard TN technology, but combat resolution works identically.

### Fleet Composition

Typical Swarm fleets consist of:

- **Scouts**: Small, fast vessels that probe jump points and detect intruders
- **Warriors**: Medium-sized combat vessels with short-range beam weapons and moderate armor
- **Queens**: Large capital ships that serve as production centers; destroying queens slows Swarm regeneration
- **Swarmlings**: Very small, numerous craft that overwhelm point defense through volume of attacks

### Strategies Against the Swarm

**Missile doctrine works well** (see [Section 12.3 Missiles](../12-combat/12.3-missiles.md)): The Swarm's large fleet counts mean your missiles always have targets, and their individual ships are fragile enough that standard warheads are effective.

**Chokepoint defense**: If the Swarm is contained to one or two jump points, fortify those jump points with bases carrying large missile magazines and beam PD. The Swarm's expansion is physical and must pass through jump points.

**Destroy queens first**: Queens are the priority target. Without queens, Swarm regeneration slows dramatically. Focus fire on the largest Swarm vessels.

**Don't wait**: The Swarm grows exponentially. A manageable threat in 2050 becomes an unstoppable wave by 2070 if left alone. Engage as soon as you have sufficient forces.

**Expect attrition**: You will lose ships against the Swarm. Design expendable missile platforms and accept losses in exchange for kills on queens.

## 18.3.3 Precursors

Precursors represent an ancient, technologically superior civilization. Unlike the Swarm, they do not expand aggressively, but their defenses are formidable and their territory often contains extremely valuable resources or technology.

### Characteristics

- **Technological superiority**: Precursor weapons and defenses are significantly more advanced than equivalent player technology. Their beam weapons have longer range, their missiles are faster, and their armor is thicker.
- **Static defense**: Precursors typically do not expand from their home systems. They defend their territory but rarely pursue retreating fleets beyond their borders.
- **Ruins and salvage**: Precursor systems often contain ruins (see [Section 17.3 Xenoarchaeology](../17-exploration/17.3-xenoarchaeology.md)) on planets that can be explored for technology bonuses, and destroyed Precursor ships can sometimes be salvaged for research insights.
- **Limited numbers**: Unlike the Swarm, Precursor fleets are small but individually powerful. Each ship is a formidable opponent.
- **No regeneration**: Precursor losses are permanent. They do not rebuild destroyed ships (in most configurations).

### Fleet Composition

Typical Precursor forces include:

- **Guardians**: Extremely well-armed and armored capital ships with advanced beam weapons. A single Guardian can destroy several player battlecruisers.
- **Sentinels**: Medium escorts with strong point defense and ECM, making missile attacks difficult.
- **Watchers**: Sensor platforms with very long-range detection capabilities. They will spot your fleet long before you detect them.
- **Orbital stations**: Fixed defensive platforms around key planets, bristling with weapons.

### Strategies Against Precursors

**Overwhelming missile volleys**: Precursor PD is strong but not infinite. Massive coordinated salvos can saturate their defenses. Design missiles for maximum salvo size.

**Long-range engagement**: Do not close to beam range unless absolutely necessary. Precursor beam weapons outrange most player equivalents. Stay at maximum missile range and wear them down.

**ECM investment**: High-level ECM on your ships reduces Precursor beam accuracy significantly. Their weapons are powerful but follow the same to-hit rules.

**Attrition warfare**: If Precursors do not regenerate in your game settings, you can whittle them down over multiple engagements. Retreat when losses become unacceptable, resupply, and return.

**Scout first**: Use small, fast sensor ships to map Precursor fleet positions before committing your battle fleet. Know what you are facing before engaging.

**Salvage opportunity**: Destroyed Precursor ships may provide research bonuses. Winning a Precursor engagement can accelerate your technology significantly.

## 18.3.4 The Rakhas

The Rakhas are an optional spoiler race representing the remnants of an ancient civilization that once had colonies across the galaxy.

### Background

The Rakhas were once a galaxy-spanning civilization that was devastated by an ancient alien invasion. Their surviving populations have regressed to isolated tribal groups with no unified civilization, no ships, and no interstellar capability. Each remnant colony is effectively a different race with potentially different levels of technology.

### Characteristics

- **Ground-only threat**: The Rakhas have no ships and are confined to planetary surfaces. They will never attack you in space.
- **Isolated tribes**: Each remnant population is independent, with no coordination between groups on different worlds.
- **Military composition**: Rakhas populations consist only of ground forces with no "civilian" population. Due to their ancient history of alien invasion, all Rakhas tribes will resist any invader.
- **Variable technology**: Their surviving technology is sufficient for Trans-Newtonian infantry and mechanized forces. Some tribes retain STO (Surface-to-Orbit) weapons capable of engaging ships in orbit.
- **Genetic advantages**: Some tribes retain genetic combat enhancements, and all tribes are familiar with warfare in the dominant terrain of their home world.
- **High-value locations**: Remnant tribes are usually encountered on worlds with oxygen atmospheres that possess multiple accessible mineral deposits, making them guardians of strategically valuable planets.

### Encounter Considerations

When encountering a Rakhas population, players face a strategic choice:

- **Ground assault** (see [Section 13.3 Ground Combat](../13-ground-forces/13.3-ground-combat.md)): Costly but preserves the planet's environment and mineral deposits for exploitation
- **Orbital bombardment**: Can wipe out Rakhas forces but risks catastrophic environmental damage, potentially making the planet less valuable or uninhabitable
- **Avoidance**: Simply colonize elsewhere, though Rakhas worlds tend to be the most mineral-rich and habitable

### Strategy

- Scout Rakhas worlds from orbit to assess their ground force strength and technological level before committing
- Prepare dedicated ground assault formations if you intend to take their worlds by force
- Consider whether the planet's mineral wealth justifies the cost of conquest
- Watch for STO weapons that can damage orbiting ships during the approach phase

## 18.3.5 Ancient Constructs

Ancient Constructs are structures discovered through anomaly surveying that provide research bonuses and serve as a critical defense mechanism against Aether Rifts. They were introduced in v1.10.0.

### Discovery and Activation

- **Origin**: Ancient Constructs spawn on system bodies using the same criteria as Ruins and are rarely (if ever) found without ruins on the same body. They are discoverable through geological surveys and appear as trackable entries on the System Map.
- **Dormant State**: Constructs remain dormant until surveyed by a xenoarchaeological formation (ground forces with xenoarchaeology components). Dormant constructs provide no bonuses.
- **Activation Requirement**: A colony with a population over one million must exist on the system body for the construct to activate. When surveyed by a xenoarchaeological formation, the construct's research field and bonus percentage become visible and the construct activates.
- **Tracking**: Active constructs can be monitored through the Constructs tab in the Economics window, which displays the applicable bonus once surveyed.

### Research Bonuses

Active Ancient Constructs provide two types of research bonus:

#### Local Bonus
Active constructs grant their full bonus percentage to research projects in their designated field that are conducted on the same system body. For example, a 60% propulsion construct provides +60% to all propulsion research conducted on that world.

#### Racial Bonus
Once a race achieves a population of at least one million on a construct's world, it provides 10% of its bonus to all research projects in its designated field for that race, regardless of where the research is conducted. For example:

- A 60% propulsion construct adds +60% locally
- The same construct adds +6% to propulsion research empire-wide (10% of 60%)
- A scientist on the construct's world receives the full +66% bonus (60% local + 6% racial)

### Aether Rift Mitigation

When Invaders are active in the game, Ancient Constructs serve as the primary defense mechanism against Aether Rift expansion:

- The combined racial bonuses from all active constructs across the galaxy reduce Aether Rift growth rates
- If the total combined racial bonuses exceed 100%, rifts begin **shrinking** instead of expanding
- Sufficient active constructs can close rifts entirely and prevent new ones from forming

### Strategic Value

Ancient Constructs represent critical strategic assets on multiple levels:

1. **Research acceleration**: Immediate benefit through research bonuses in specific fields
2. **Galactic defense**: Long-term protection against the extradimensional Invader threat
3. **Colony incentive**: Encourages colonization of construct worlds to activate the racial bonus (requires 1 million population)
4. **Priority targets**: Constructs should be discovered and activated as quickly as possible, particularly when Invaders are enabled

## 18.3.6 Aether Rifts

Aether Rifts are dimensional passages that appear in star systems when the Invaders option is active. They serve as the entry point for Invader and Raider forces and represent an escalating galactic threat.

### Appearance

Rifts manifest as black zones with indigo borders on the system map. They appear in systems based on a probability that increases over time from the Invader Start Time.

### Growth Mechanics

Rifts grow continuously based on the following formula:

**Growth per phase = (Construction Phase Length / Year Length) x 10%**

- Rifts typically initiate at 10 million kilometers in diameter
- They expand each construction phase according to the formula above
- Growth rate is modified by active Ancient Constructs, which provide negative modifiers
- If total Ancient Construct racial bonuses exceed 100%, rifts shrink instead of growing

### Radiation Damage

System bodies whose orbits pass through an Aether Rift sustain radiation damage:

**Radiation Damage = (Rift Diameter / 10,000) x (Construction Phase Length / Year Length)**

For example, a body spending one 5-day construction phase inside a 20-million-km rift sustains approximately 27 radiation damage. This radiation can devastate colonies on affected worlds, making rift containment a priority for inhabited systems.

### Raiding Forces

As time passes, raiding forces emerge from Aether Rifts and attack any targets they can find:

- Forces scale with rift size -- larger rifts produce stronger raiding groups
- Raiders improve technologically over time, becoming progressively more dangerous
- Raiding fleets may include gravitational survey ships that seek out new locations for rift formation
- Specialized stabilization vessels can open additional rifts in new systems, spreading the threat

### Closure Mechanism

The only method for containing or closing Aether Rifts is activating sufficient Ancient Constructs:

- Combined racial bonuses from all active constructs reduce rift growth rates
- When total bonuses exceed 100%, rifts begin to shrink
- With enough active constructs, new rifts cannot form and existing ones close entirely
- This creates a race between rift expansion and construct activation
- As of v1.12.0, new rift generation probability is reduced proportionally to the number of active constructs in the galaxy, even before the 100% threshold is reached. This means early construct activation provides immediate defensive value by slowing rift appearances.

### Strategic Response

- **Early detection**: Monitor systems for rift formation, particularly after the Invader Start Time threshold
- **Construct priority**: Discover and activate Ancient Constructs as the primary long-term defense
- **Colony management**: Evacuate or defend populations on bodies at risk of rift contact
- **Force readiness**: Maintain combat fleets capable of engaging raiding forces that emerge from rifts
- **Prevent spread**: Destroy stabilization vessels before they can open new rifts in additional systems

## 18.3.7 Aether Raiders

Aether Raiders are a spoiler faction that employs hit-and-run raiding tactics using advanced cloaking and stealth technology. They emerge from an inaccessible home system and prey on player shipping and colonies.

### Spawning and Activation

- **Trigger:** Raiders appear when the player discovers a configurable number of star systems (default: 10, including the starting system)
- **Home System:** Raiders operate from an inaccessible home system with no jump points connecting to the normal galaxy
- **Travel Mechanism:** Raiders use temporary "Aether gates" for travel rather than normal jump points or jump gates. Aether gates are not detectable by the player
- **Persistence:** Individual raider ships retain their identity across jumps; the same vessel may reappear in different systems over time
- **Growth:** Raiders receive free ships or research over time, becoming progressively more dangerous

### Combat Characteristics

- **Stealth Focus:** Heavy emphasis on cloaking and thermal reduction technology, making raiders extremely difficult to detect
- **Hit-and-Run Doctrine:** Raiders engage in quick strikes and retreat unless victory is certain
- **Conservative Tactics:** Raiders are conservative with their forces and will withdraw rather than risk losses in uncertain engagements
- **Beam Preference:** Often employ relatively fast beam warships equipped with railguns, making them elusive opponents

### Ship Types

| Type | Relative Scale | Role |
|------|---------------|------|
| Small Raider | 1x | Main workhorse; beam/railgun equipped |
| Escort | 1x | Group leader; provides diversified capabilities |
| Large Raider | 2x | Heavier variant with more weapons |
| Salvager | 10x+ | Slow non-combatant; processes wrecks for resources |
| Slave Transport | 3x | Captures escape pods and populations |
| Troop Transport | 5x | Carries ground invasion forces |

### Strategies Against Raiders

- **Sensor Networks:** Invest in extensive passive sensor coverage (see [Section 11.1 Thermal and EM Signatures](../11-sensors-and-detection/11.1-thermal-em-signatures.md)) along trade routes. Thermal and EM sensors can detect Raiders despite their stealth, albeit at reduced ranges
- **Fast Response Fleets:** Station fast interceptor groups at key systems. Raiders will flee from superior forces, so rapid response is more important than overwhelming firepower
- **Convoy Escorts:** Protect high-value shipping with escort warships. Raiders prefer undefended targets
- **Active Sensor Pickets:** Raiders' cloaking defeats passive sensors at long range. Active sensor platforms along likely approach vectors can reveal them earlier

## 18.3.8 Spoiler Race Start Times

In v2.2, each spoiler faction (Raiders, Swarm, and Invaders) receives its own independent start time, creating more balanced difficulty progression.

### Triggering Mechanism

Each spoiler faction's start time is set when the player discovers a configurable number of star systems. For example, if Raiders are configured to activate after 10 systems are discovered, the date when the 10th system is found becomes the "Raider Start Time."

### Time-Based Calculations

Once triggered, each faction measures elapsed time from its individual start time (not from game start) for key mechanics:

- **Invaders**: Aether Rift formation chances and invasion frequency through existing rifts scale based on time elapsed since the Invader Start Time
- **Raiders**: Operational group creation and research facility additions scale based on time elapsed since the Raider Start Time. As of v2.1.1, Raiders only begin generating additional ships after the player reaches the system count threshold triggering their appearance -- they do not accumulate forces during the pre-trigger period
- **Swarm**: Starting technology points are determined by time elapsed since the Swarm Start Time

### Design Purpose

This system prevents experienced players in slow-start scenarios (such as conventional starts) from facing disproportionately powerful adversaries immediately upon triggering discovery thresholds. The elapsed-time approach allows natural difficulty scaling aligned with actual gameplay progression rather than absolute game time.

### Configuration

The number of systems required to trigger each faction's start time is configurable through the Game Details window, allowing players to control when each threat becomes active relative to their exploration progress.

### Minimum Player Systems for Spoilers

In addition to start time triggers, three fields in the Create Game window (settable only at game start) delay spoiler encounters until the player's empire reaches a specified size:

- **Minimum Known Player Systems for Aether Raiders:** Raiders will not launch any raids until the player has discovered this many systems.
- **Minimum Known Player Systems for Star Swarm:** Swarm will not be generated in new systems until the threshold is met.
- **Minimum Known Player Systems for Invaders:** Aether Rifts will not be formed (in new or existing systems) until the threshold is met.

This differs from disabling spoilers entirely. Background development continues while the threshold is unmet -- raiders and swarm gain technology, and invaders accumulate forces based on total game time. The feature delays first contact, allowing players to establish their empire before facing threats, but a delayed spoiler may be more powerful when finally encountered.

## 18.3.9 Starting Tech Points for NPRs and Spoilers

v2.0 introduced significant changes to how newly generated races receive initial research points, applying the research speed modifier to starting tech points for NPRs, Star Swarm, Rakhas, and Aether Raiders.

### Research Modifier Application

Previously, research speed modifiers only applied to ongoing research, not starting tech points. Under the current system, the research modifier is applied to starting tech points, preventing late-game NPRs and Swarm from becoming disproportionately powerful in low research-rate games.

### Minimum Starting Points

The system establishes floor values to preserve gameplay balance regardless of research modifier settings:

| Faction | Minimum Starting Points | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Rakhas | 100,000 | Ground-only threat, lowest minimum |
| NPRs | 120,000 | Standard non-player civilizations |
| Aether Raiders | 400,000 | Raiding forces require meaningful tech base |
| Star Swarm | 600,000 | Biological threat needs sufficient biomass tech |
| Precursors | 600,000 or 20% above max player | Whichever is higher |
| Invaders | 1,000,000 or 50% above max player | Whichever is higher |

### Gameplay Impact

This change has minimal effect on early-game encounters but significantly prevents late-game power imbalances. For early-game concerns, players can use the Minimum Player Systems settings to delay encounters until they are prepared.

## 18.3.10 Collateral Damage (v1.14)

Collateral damage represents environmental destruction caused by ground combat, relevant when assaulting Rakhas worlds or any defended colony.

### Mechanics

The collateral damage calculation uses a final divisor of 50,000 (changed from 10,000 in earlier versions), resulting in an 80% reduction from original values. This change was made because the original mechanic was deemed too punitive, discouraging ground combat entirely rather than creating meaningful tactical choices.

### Design Intent

The mechanic is intended to present a trade-off between:

- **Lighter forces:** Slower victory but potentially less environmental damage.
- **Heavier forces:** Faster victory but with increased collateral damage.

With the v1.14 reduction, collateral damage now functions as a minor combat side-effect rather than a primary strategic constraint. Players can engage in ground combat (particularly against Rakhas) without excessive concern that environmental destruction will outweigh the military benefits of conquest.

### Relevance to Spoiler Encounters

This is particularly relevant when:

- Assaulting Rakhas-held worlds with valuable minerals and habitable atmospheres.
- Conducting ground operations against NPR colonies.
- Weighing ground assault versus orbital bombardment (which has its own, separate environmental impact).

## 18.3.11 The Ancients (v2.7.0)

The Ancients are a non-hostile spoiler race that predates even the Precursors. Unlike other spoiler races, they are not hostile and represent an exploration and salvage opportunity rather than a military threat.

### Characteristics

- **Non-hostile**: The Ancients do not attack or defend. They are entirely extinct.
- **Scattered remnants**: Ancient artifacts are scattered across the galaxy in the form of dormant colonies with intact facilities, harvester stations, terraforming stations, maintenance bases, and rare warships.
- **No crew or population**: Ancient colonies lack populations. Ancient ships lack crews. They are empty husks awaiting discovery.
- **Pre-Precursor**: The Ancients predate the Precursor civilization, representing a yet older era of galactic history.

### What You Can Find

| Discovery Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Dormant Colonies | Intact installations on planetary surfaces, ready to activate |
| Harvester Stations | Fuel harvesting platforms at gas giants |
| Terraforming Stations | Environmental modification equipment |
| Maintenance Bases | Ship repair facilities |
| Warships (rare) | Crewless military vessels that can potentially be recovered |

### Discovery Mechanics

- Discovery chance varies by location, with higher probability on bodies that have ancient connections
- Ancient sites are found during standard exploration and geological survey operations
- Colonies can be claimed by establishing a population on the same body

### Strategic Value

The Ancients represent free infrastructure — installations, ships, and facilities that cost nothing to acquire beyond the exploration effort to find them. In the early game, discovering an Ancient colony can provide a significant economic boost through ready-made facilities.

## 18.3.12 Solar System Destruction (v2.7.0)

A new apocalyptic scenario option where exotic matter disrupts the sun, forcing the player to escape the home system before it explodes.

### Mechanics

- **Escalating radiation**: Annual radiation damage to system bodies follows the formula:
  ```
  Radiation = ((Years since start) ^ 3) × (1 / (Body Distance AU ^ 2)) × Scenario Factor
  ```

- **Three difficulty variants**: Scenario factors of 0.005 (easy), 0.0075 (medium), and 0.01 (hard) control escalation speed
- **Solar explosion**: After year 50, the sun has a probability of exploding each year: `(Game Years - 50) × 2%`
- **Permanent destruction**: When the sun explodes, the Sol system is deleted entirely and all jump point connections to Sol are broken

### Strategic Implications

- Inner planets become uninhabitable first due to distance-squared radiation scaling
- Players must prioritize interstellar colonization and fleet relocation
- The scenario creates urgent time pressure absent from standard games
- Jump point exploration and colony establishment become existential priorities

## 18.3.13 Other Spoiler Types

### Star Swallowers

An extremely rare and catastrophic threat. Star Swallowers are planet-sized entities that consume stars, destroying entire systems.

- **Detection**: Approaching Star Swallowers can be detected by unusual gravitational readings in neighboring systems.
- **Engagement**: Conventional weapons are ineffective. Star Swallowers require specialized approaches or may simply be threats you must evacuate ahead of.
- **Consequence**: If a Star Swallower reaches a system, all bodies and colonies in that system are destroyed. Permanent loss.
- **Strategy**: Early detection through extensive survey networks is essential. Evacuation of threatened systems is the only reliable response for most empires.

### Guardians (System Guardians)

Ancient automated defenses that protect specific systems, distinct from Precursor forces.

- **Triggered by entry**: Guardians activate only when a player ship enters their protected system.
- **Fixed position**: They do not pursue beyond their system borders.
- **Extremely powerful**: Individual Guardian platforms can be stronger than Precursor Guardians.
- **Worth the effort**: Systems protected by Guardians often contain extraordinarily rich mineral deposits or valuable alien ruins.
- **Strategy**: Approach with overwhelming force or not at all. Hit-and-run tactics are risky since Guardians often have excellent sensors.

## 18.3.14 Game Creation Settings

When starting a new game, you can configure:

- **Which spoiler types are enabled**: Toggle each type on or off individually (Swarm, Raiders, Invaders, Rakhas, etc.).
- **System discovery thresholds**: Configure how many systems must be discovered before each faction's start time is triggered.
- **Distance from Sol**: Control how far from the starting system spoiler races can appear. Greater distance gives more preparation time but also means more infrastructure to defend.
- **Spoiler density**: How many spoiler instances can exist simultaneously in the galaxy.

## 18.3.15 General Preparation Advice

Regardless of which spoiler races are enabled:

1. **Never explore without a plan**: Have military forces ready before pushing into unknown space.
2. **Maintain a strategic reserve**: Keep a fleet in reserve that is not committed to any border, ready to respond to new threats.
3. **Invest in sensors** (see [Section 11.1 Thermal and EM Signatures](../11-sensors-and-detection/11.1-thermal-em-signatures.md)): Long-range detection gives you time to react. Sensor bases at key jump points provide early warning.
4. **Research military technology continuously**: Do not neglect weapons and defense research during peacetime. The next threat may appear without warning.
5. **Diversify your forces**: Different spoiler types require different approaches. A fleet optimized for one threat may be vulnerable to another.
6. **Activate Ancient Constructs**: When Invaders are enabled, discovering and activating constructs is your only long-term defense against Aether Rifts. Prioritize xenoarchaeological surveys of anomalies.
7. **Prepare ground forces for Rakhas**: If Rakhas are enabled, maintain capable ground assault formations for taking high-value Rakhas worlds without orbital bombardment.
8. **Monitor start time triggers**: Be aware of how many systems you have discovered relative to spoiler activation thresholds. Discovering systems too quickly can trigger threats before you are prepared.
