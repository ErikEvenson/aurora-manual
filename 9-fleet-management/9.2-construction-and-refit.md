# 9.2 Construction and Refit

Once your shipyards are established and tooled, the process of actually building, refitting, and scrapping ships becomes a routine but critical part of fleet management. This section covers the full lifecycle of a vessel from keel-laying to the scrapyard.

## 9.2.1 Building Ships

**Starting Construction:** To build a ship, navigate to the Economics window (F2), select the Shipyard tab, choose a shipyard that has been retooled for the desired ship class, and click the button to begin construction. If the yard has multiple slipways available, you can start multiple ships of the same class simultaneously.

**Mineral Costs:** Each ship class has a specific mineral cost determined by its components, listed in the Ship Designer. The minerals required include:

- **Duranium** -- Hull structure, armor, most mechanical components
- **Neutronium** -- Armor, some specialized components
- **Corbomite** -- Armor
- **Tritanium** -- Engines, power plants
- **Boronide** -- Power systems, capacitors
- **Mercassium** -- Electronics, sensors, fire control
- **Vendarite** -- Life support, crew facilities
- **Sorium** -- Fuel (stored separately, loaded after construction)
- **Uridium** -- Advanced electronics, weapons
- **Corundium** -- Advanced weapon systems
- **Gallicite** -- Engines (critical for all ship construction)

Minerals are consumed from the colony's stockpile as construction progresses, not all at once. If a required mineral runs out, construction pauses until the mineral becomes available again.

**Construction Time:** The time to build a ship equals its total Build Point (BP) cost divided by the BP output of the slipway constructing it. BP output is affected by:

- Shipyard type (naval yards have higher per-slipway output)
- Number of Shipyard Workers assigned
- Governor bonuses (if the colony's governor has a shipbuilding bonus)
- Racial production modifiers

**Monitoring Progress:** The Shipyard tab shows the percentage completion and estimated time remaining for each ship under construction. Ships under construction are not visible in the fleet window until completed.

**Completion:** When a ship finishes construction, it appears in orbit of the colony that built it, fully crewed (assuming sufficient population), and with its fuel tanks empty. You must fuel the ship before it can travel. New ships are automatically added to a "Pool" or can be assigned to a task group.

> **Tip:** Always have fuel production and transport infrastructure in place before ships complete construction. A newly-built warship sitting in orbit unfueled is a wasted investment. Consider building a fuel depot at your main construction colony.

> **Tip:** Queue multiple ships of the same class if your mineral supply allows it. This keeps your yards productive without the downtime of retooling between different classes.

## 9.2.2 Refitting Ships

Refitting allows you to upgrade existing ships to a newer design without building from scratch. This is particularly valuable for upgrading sensor suites, fire control systems, or engines on ships whose hulls are still serviceable.

**When to Refit:**
- A new technology has been researched that significantly improves a component (e.g., better engines, improved sensors)
- A design flaw has been identified in an existing class
- You want to standardize a mixed fleet to a single updated design
- The cost of refitting is significantly less than building new

**How to Refit:**
1. Create a new ship class in the Ship Designer that represents the upgraded version (it must have the same hull size or the yard must accommodate both sizes)
2. In the Economics window, select the shipyard and set it to the refit task
3. Select the ship to refit and the target design
4. The ship must be in orbit of the colony with the shipyard
5. Begin the refit

**Refit Costs and Time:** The cost of a refit is based on the difference between the old and new designs. Components that remain unchanged cost nothing. Only new, removed, or swapped components contribute to the refit cost. The time required is proportional to this differential cost.

**Restrictions:**
- The target design must fit within the shipyard's tonnage capacity
- The shipyard must be retooled for the target class (or retooled as part of the process)
- The ship being refitted cannot be deployed -- it must be at the colony
- Crew may need to be adjusted if the new design has different crew requirements

> **Tip:** When designing ships, consider future refit paths. Leaving some unused hull space in early designs makes later refits simpler. A modular design philosophy -- where weapons and sensors can be swapped without changing the core hull -- saves enormous resources over a ship class's lifetime.

> **Tip:** Refit is almost always more cost-effective than building new if the hull is unchanged. A 15,000-ton cruiser that needs only a sensor upgrade might cost 10-20% of the original build cost to refit, versus 100% to build a replacement from scratch.

## 9.2.3 Scrapping

Ships that are obsolete, damaged beyond economical repair, or simply surplus to requirements can be scrapped to recover a portion of their mineral investment.

**How to Scrap:**
1. Move the ship to a colony with a shipyard (the shipyard does not need to be retooled for that class)
2. In the Shipyard tab or the Task Group window, assign the ship for scrapping
3. The scrapping process takes time proportional to the ship's size

**Mineral Recovery:** Scrapping a ship returns a percentage of the minerals used in its construction back to the colony's stockpile. The recovery rate is typically around 25-50% of the original mineral cost, depending on game settings. This makes scrapping worthwhile for large obsolete vessels even if the recovered minerals are modest compared to active mining.

**When to Scrap:**
- Ships with obsolete technology that cannot be cost-effectively refitted
- Severely damaged ships where repair costs exceed replacement costs
- Excess ships of a class you no longer need (maintenance costs continue on idle ships)
- Captured enemy vessels whose technology is incompatible with your fleet

**Scrapping vs. Mothballing:** Before scrapping, consider whether the ship might have future utility. Scrapping is permanent. If you merely want to reduce maintenance costs temporarily, you can place ships in a reserve fleet or simply leave them unfueled in orbit.

> **Tip:** Early-game survey ships and scouts are prime candidates for scrapping once their role is fulfilled. Their recovered minerals can contribute to your first warship construction runs.

> **Tip:** Don't neglect scrapping old ships. Every vessel in your fleet incurs maintenance costs in minerals, and those costs add up. A fleet of 20 obsolete frigates sitting idle consumes minerals that could be building modern destroyers.
