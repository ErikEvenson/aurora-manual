# 9.2 Construction and Refit

Once your shipyards are established and tooled, the process of actually building, refitting, and scrapping ships becomes a routine but critical part of fleet management. This section covers the full lifecycle of a vessel from keel-laying to the scrapyard.

## 9.2.1 Building Ships

**Starting Construction:** To build a ship, navigate to the Economics window (F2), select the Shipyard tab, choose a shipyard that has been retooled for the desired ship class, and click the button to begin construction. If the yard has multiple slipways available, you can start multiple ships of the same class simultaneously.

**Mineral Costs:** Each ship class has a specific mineral cost determined by its components, listed in the Ship Designer. The minerals required include:

- **Duranium** -- Hull structure, armor, most mechanical components
- **Neutronium** -- Armor, some specialized components
- **Corbomite** -- Armor
- **Tritanium** -- Engines, power plants
- **Boronide** -- Power systems, capacitors
- **Mercassium** -- Electronics, sensors, fire control
- **Vendarite** -- Life support, crew facilities
- **Sorium** -- Fuel (stored separately, loaded after construction)
- **Uridium** -- Advanced electronics, weapons
- **Corundium** -- Advanced weapon systems
- **Gallicite** -- Engines (critical for all ship construction)

Minerals are consumed from the colony's stockpile as construction progresses, not all at once. If a required mineral runs out, construction pauses until the mineral becomes available again.

**Construction Time:** The time to build a ship equals its total Build Point (BP) cost divided by the BP output of the slipway constructing it. BP output is affected by:

- Shipyard type (naval yards have higher per-slipway output)
- Number of Shipyard Workers assigned
- Governor bonuses (if the colony's governor has a shipbuilding bonus)
- Racial production modifiers

**Monitoring Progress:** The Shipyard tab shows the percentage completion and estimated time remaining for each ship under construction. Ships under construction are not visible in the fleet window until completed.

**Completion:** When a ship finishes construction, it appears in orbit of the colony that built it, fully crewed (assuming sufficient population), and with its fuel tanks empty. You must fuel the ship before it can travel. New ships are automatically added to a "Pool" or can be assigned to a task group.

> **Tip:** Always have fuel production and transport infrastructure in place before ships complete construction. A newly-built warship sitting in orbit unfueled is a wasted investment. Consider building a fuel depot at your main construction colony.

> **Tip:** Queue multiple ships of the same class if your mineral supply allows it. This keeps your yards productive without the downtime of retooling between different classes.

## 9.2.2 Refitting Ships

Refitting allows you to upgrade existing ships to a newer design without building from scratch. This is particularly valuable for upgrading sensor suites, fire control systems, or engines on ships whose hulls are still serviceable.

**When to Refit:**
- A new technology has been researched that significantly improves a component (e.g., better engines, improved sensors)
- A design flaw has been identified in an existing class
- You want to standardize a mixed fleet to a single updated design
- The cost of refitting is significantly less than building new

**How to Refit:**
1. Create a new ship class in the Ship Designer that represents the upgraded version
2. In the Economics window, select the shipyard and set it to the refit task
3. Select the ship to refit and the target design
4. The ship must be in orbit of the colony with the shipyard
5. Begin the refit

**Refit Size Restrictions (C# Formula):**

In C# Aurora, the refit size calculation was fundamentally redesigned from VB6:

- **VB6 Formula:** `ABS(Current HS - Refit HS) * 5`
- **C# Formula:** `(ABS(Current HS - Refit HS) / Current HS) * Refit Cost`

The C# approach uses a percentage-based modifier rather than an absolute value, creating more realistic cost outcomes. A critical restriction applies: **you cannot refit a ship to a design that is more than 20% smaller or 20% larger than the existing design.** This prevents unrealistic cost situations and reduces clutter in the "Refit from" dropdown menu.

Note that the 20% restriction is asymmetric. For example, a class of 10,000 tons could be refitted to a class of 8,000 tons (within 20% of the original), but the reverse would not be true (10,000 is 25% larger than 8,000, exceeding the 20% limit).

**Refit Costs:**

A dedicated section in the Miscellaneous tab of the Class Design window displays refit costs, showing:

- Cost to refit **from** the selected class to each eligible alternative
- Cost to refit **to** the selected class from each eligible alternative
- A percentage column indicating what portion of the target class cost is required
- Percentage of cost for both original and refitted ships
- Identification of situations where original and refitted variants may be built in the same shipyard

The percentage value represents the refit cost as a proportion of the destination class's build cost, allowing you to quickly assess economic viability. You can build either your tooled class or any other class where refit costs remain below 20% of the target vessel's cost.

**Consumables During Refit:** When a ship undergoes refit, fuel, maintenance supplies, and ordnance are automatically moved from (or to) the refitting population to account for the differences post-refit. This ensures the ship has appropriate consumable levels for its new configuration.

**Restrictions:**
- **You cannot refit a damaged ship** -- the vessel must be fully repaired before any refit can begin
- The target design must be within 20% of the original ship's tonnage (larger or smaller)
- The target design must fit within the shipyard's tonnage capacity
- The shipyard must be retooled for the target class (or retooled as part of the process)
- The ship being refitted cannot be deployed -- it must be at the colony
- Crew may need to be adjusted if the new design has different crew requirements

**Auto Refit Tasks:**

The Auto Refit task works identically to a standard Refit task with one key difference: when the task is finished, the shipyard will automatically start a new refit task using the same target class. Specifically, if you auto-refit Class A to Class B, when the task completes the shipyard will check for another Class A ship in the same location and automatically begin refitting it. If no eligible ship is found, the auto refit task ends.

This is particularly valuable for refitting fighters, which can now be refitted in shipyards in C# Aurora. Without auto refit, refitting a squadron of fighters would require tedious manual refit orders for each individual craft.

> **Tip:** When designing ships, consider future refit paths. Leaving some unused hull space in early designs makes later refits simpler. A modular design philosophy -- where weapons and sensors can be swapped without changing the core hull -- saves enormous resources over a ship class's lifetime.

> **Tip:** Refit is almost always more cost-effective than building new if the hull is unchanged. A 15,000-ton cruiser that needs only a sensor upgrade might cost 10-20% of the original build cost to refit, versus 100% to build a replacement from scratch.

> **Tip:** Check the refit costs section in the Class Design window before committing to a refit. If the percentage cost exceeds 60-70% of building new, it may be more economical to simply construct a new vessel and scrap the old one.

## 9.2.3 Scrapping

Ships that are obsolete, damaged beyond economical repair, or simply surplus to requirements can be scrapped to recover a portion of their mineral investment.

**How to Scrap:**
1. Move the ship to a colony with a shipyard (the shipyard does not need to be retooled for that class)
2. In the Shipyard tab or the Task Group window, assign the ship for scrapping
3. The scrapping process takes time proportional to the ship's size

**Intelligent Scrapping:** In C# Aurora, the scrapping/deleting process is much more intelligent about handling ship contents. When a ship is scrapped:
- Commanders and officers are automatically moved to the scrapping population
- Assigned teams are relocated to the colony
- Ground units aboard are transferred to the scrapping population
- Fuel, maintenance supplies, and ordnance are automatically unloaded to the colony's stockpile

This eliminates the need to manually unload a ship's contents before scrapping and prevents the loss of valuable personnel and equipment.

**Mineral Recovery:** Scrapping a ship returns a percentage of the minerals used in its construction back to the colony's stockpile. The recovery rate is typically around 25-50% of the original mineral cost, depending on game settings. This makes scrapping worthwhile for large obsolete vessels even if the recovered minerals are modest compared to active mining.

**When to Scrap:**
- Ships with obsolete technology that cannot be cost-effectively refitted
- Severely damaged ships where repair costs exceed replacement costs
- Excess ships of a class you no longer need (maintenance costs continue on idle ships)
- Captured enemy vessels whose technology is incompatible with your fleet

**Scrapping vs. Mothballing:** Before scrapping, consider whether the ship might have future utility. Scrapping is permanent. If you merely want to reduce maintenance costs temporarily, you can place ships in a reserve fleet or simply leave them unfueled in orbit.

> **Tip:** Early-game survey ships and scouts are prime candidates for scrapping once their role is fulfilled. Their recovered minerals can contribute to your first warship construction runs.

> **Tip:** Don't neglect scrapping old ships. Every vessel in your fleet incurs maintenance costs in minerals, and those costs add up. A fleet of 20 obsolete frigates sitting idle consumes minerals that could be building modern destroyers.
