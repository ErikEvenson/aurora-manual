# 9.1 Shipyards

Shipyards are the industrial backbone of your space navy. Every warship, freighter, and colony vessel your empire fields must be constructed in a shipyard. Understanding shipyard mechanics is essential for maintaining a capable fleet without bankrupting your economy.

Shipyards are managed through the **Economics** window (F2), under the **Shipyard** tab. Each colony with shipyard complexes will display them here, along with their current tasks, capacity, and assigned ship classes.

## 9.1.1 Naval vs Commercial Shipyards

Aurora C# distinguishes between three types of shipyard:

**Naval Shipyards** build warships -- any vessel designed with military-grade components such as weapons, fire control systems, military-grade engines, or armor beyond the minimum. Naval shipyards are smaller in initial capacity (typically starting at 1,000 tons) and more expensive to expand, but they are the only yards capable of constructing combat vessels.

**Commercial Shipyards** build civilian and support vessels -- freighters, colony ships, fuel harvesters, terraformers, salvagers, and any other ship class that does not incorporate restricted military components. Commercial shipyards start with a larger default capacity (typically 10,000 tons) and are significantly cheaper to expand per ton of capacity added.

**Repair Yards** are a specialized third shipyard type dedicated to restoring damaged vessels rather than constructing new ones. Repair yards share identical construction costs with standard shipyards and begin with a baseline capacity of 10,000 tons. They cannot build new ships but can repair damaged vessels without requiring retooling for a specific class.

**Key Differences:**

| Feature | Naval Shipyard | Commercial Shipyard | Repair Yard |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Starting Capacity | 1,000 tons | 10,000 tons | 10,000 tons |
| Expansion Cost | Higher per ton | Lower per ton | Same as naval/commercial |
| Build Speed | Faster (more BP per slipway) | Slower (fewer BP per slipway) | N/A (repair only) |
| Ship Types | Military vessels | Civilian/support vessels | Any (repair only) |
| Slipway Cost | Higher | Lower | Same as standard |
| Primary Role | Construction | Construction | Repair |

**Determining Ship Type:** The game automatically classifies a ship design as military or commercial based on its components. If a design includes any explicitly military component (beam weapons, missile launchers, military engines, significant armor, etc.), it requires a naval shipyard. Otherwise, it can be built in a commercial yard.

> **Tip:** Some players build "Q-ships" -- ostensibly commercial vessels with hidden military components. These require naval shipyards despite their civilian appearance. Conversely, a sensor picket with only passive sensors and commercial engines can be built in a commercial yard.

## 9.1.2 Shipyard Capacity

Each shipyard has two critical capacity metrics: **tonnage capacity** and **number of slipways**.

**Tonnage Capacity** determines the maximum size of ship the yard can build. A yard with 10,000-ton capacity can build any ship class of 10,000 tons or smaller. You cannot begin construction of a ship larger than your yard's capacity -- the yard must first be expanded.

**Slipways** represent the number of ships a yard can build simultaneously. Each slipway can construct one vessel at a time. A yard with 3 slipways can have up to 3 ships under construction concurrently. Adding slipways is one of the most cost-effective ways to increase your fleet production rate.

**Build Points (BP):** Each slipway generates a fixed number of build points per year, determined by the shipyard's type and your empire's production modifiers. The total build points required for a ship equals its cost in build points (shown in the ship designer). Construction time equals total BP cost divided by BP generated per year per slipway.

**Starting Build Points:** A new player race in Aurora receives a number of Starting Build Points equal to two years of wealth. These can be used for instant construction at game start. When instant build points are available, an "Instant Build" section appears in the Class window's Miscellaneous tab, displaying the current point total alongside options to select a destination fleet and the quantity of ships to construct. The same functionality is available on the Ground Unit Training tab of the Economics window for building ground formations. This instant build functionality also remains accessible in SM (Supervisor) Mode for scenario setup purposes.

**Workforce:** Shipyards require workers from the colony's population to function. Insufficient workforce reduces the effective build rate of the yard.

In C# Aurora, the shipyard workforce formula was redesigned from VB6 to scale proportionally with shipyard size rather than using a flat base requirement:

- **Naval Shipyards:** 250 workers per ton of capacity
- **Commercial Shipyards:** 25 workers per ton of capacity
- **No base worker requirement** (unlike VB6 which required 1 million workers as a base)

This means a 10,000-ton naval shipyard requires 2,500,000 workers, while a 100,000-ton commercial shipyard requires 2,500,000 workers. The formula mirrors workforce requirements for construction factories, mines, and research facilities, where staffing directly corresponds to productive capacity.

> **Tip:** Early game, focus on adding slipways rather than expanding tonnage. Two slipways building 5,000-ton destroyers produces fleet tonnage faster than one slipway building 10,000-ton cruisers, and smaller ships are individually less costly to lose.

## 9.1.3 Expanding and Retooling

Shipyards can be modified in several ways through the Economics window:

**Adding Slipways:** Increases the number of ships that can be built simultaneously. This is a construction task that takes time and resources but does not interrupt any ships currently under construction in existing slipways. Each additional slipway costs a fixed amount of minerals.

**Expanding Capacity:** Increases the maximum tonnage the yard can handle. Capacity expansion is incremental -- each expansion task adds a set number of tons (typically 1,000 for naval, 10,000 for commercial). Expansion tasks are queued and processed sequentially. The yard remains operational during expansion, but cannot begin construction of ships exceeding its current capacity until the expansion completes.

**Continual Capacity Upgrade Target:** When using the Continual Capacity Upgrade shipyard task, you can set a target capacity. The upgrade will automatically end when it reaches that target capacity. This prevents indefinite or wasteful upgrade cycles by establishing a defined endpoint, allowing resources to be allocated to other projects once the desired capacity is achieved.

**Retooling:** When you assign a new ship class to a shipyard, the yard must retool to build that class. Retooling takes time proportional to the difference between the old and new designs. If the new class is similar to the old one (sharing many components), retooling is faster. A yard retooling from scratch (no previous assignment) takes the full retooling time.

Each shipyard can only be tooled to build one specific ship class at a time. To build a different class, you must either retool an existing yard or have another yard already tooled for that class.

**Retooling Considerations:**
- Retooling a yard halts any construction in progress on that yard
- The more different the new design is from the old, the longer retooling takes
- You can queue a retool order to begin after current construction completes
- Having multiple yards tooled for different classes provides strategic flexibility

**Shipyard Tasks Priority:** You can have multiple tasks queued for a single shipyard (e.g., expand capacity, then add slipway, then retool). Tasks are processed in the order assigned.

> **Tip:** Plan your shipyard infrastructure well in advance. A common strategy is to maintain one naval yard per major warship class (e.g., one for destroyers, one for cruisers) and retool only when a significantly improved design is ready. Retooling frequently wastes valuable production time.

> **Tip:** When starting a new game, immediately begin expanding your starting shipyard capacity and adding slipways. These investments pay dividends throughout the entire game as your fleet requirements grow.
