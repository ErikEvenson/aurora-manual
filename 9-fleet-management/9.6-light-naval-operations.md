# 9.6 Light Naval Operations

*Added: v2026.01.24*

Light Naval is the unified classification for all military vessels of 1,000 tons or less, introduced in v2.8.0. This replaces the older fighter/FAC distinction -- while informal terminology persists, there are no longer mechanical differences between "fighters" and "FACs." This section consolidates all Light Naval mechanics: classification thresholds, construction, squadron organization, carrier operations, commander bonuses, and design considerations.

## 9.6.1 Light Naval Classification

The 1,000-ton threshold is the single dividing line between Light Naval and standard naval vessels *(unverified -- v2.8.0 change not yet in AuroraDB v2.7.1)*. Ships at or below this tonnage receive a distinct set of mechanical treatments that affect construction, command, and tactical operations.

### Mechanical Implications of the 1,000-Ton Threshold

| Mechanic | Light Naval (<=1,000t) | Standard Naval (>1,000t) |
|----------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Commander bonuses | Full bonus | Half (6 skills*) |
| Tactical bonus type | Light Tactical | Tactical (standard) |
| Surface interaction | Yes | No |
| Cargo shuttle bays | Not required | Required for loading |
| Bridge requirement | Not required | Required (auto at 1,100t) |
| Construction | LN Factories or LN Shipyards | Naval Shipyards only |
| Retooling | Not required (LN Shipyards) | Required per class |
| Hangar maintenance | Suspended | Suspended |

*Half-bonus skills: Crew Training, Survey, Engineering, Tactical, Carrier Ops, Ground Support *(unverified -- v2.8.0 mechanic; the bonus types exist in AuroraDB v2.7.1 \hyperlink{ref-9.6-4}{[4]} but the half-bonus behavior cannot be verified against the current database)*.

### Surface Interaction Limit

The surface interaction limit -- the maximum tonnage at which a ship can operate at a planetary surface rather than in orbit -- was raised from 500 tons to 1,000 tons as of v2.8.0. This means all Light Naval vessels can:

- Load and unload cargo and colonists directly without cargo shuttle bays (see [Section 8.6.6 Fuel Tanks and Cargo](../8-ship-design/8.6-other-components.md))
- Operate from planetary surfaces for ground support missions
- Land at and launch from surface installations

Ships of 500 tons or less additionally receive a built-in virtual cargo shuttle bay (v2.4.0), eliminating the need to mount one explicitly.

## 9.6.2 Construction

Light Naval vessels can be produced through two dedicated infrastructure types, both designed for rapid, flexible production of small warships.

### Light Naval Factories

Light Naval Factories (renamed from Fighter Factories in v2.8.0) are ground-based production facilities that build any military ship of 1,000 tons or less:

- Function identically to the former Fighter Factories but with the expanded 1,000-ton ceiling
- Managed through the Economics window (F2)
- Significantly faster and cheaper than shipyard construction for small vessels
- Can produce any class at or below 1,000 tons without retooling
- Require mineral resources from the colony stockpile

Light Naval Factories are the primary production method for large numbers of small combatants. Their lack of retooling requirements means you can switch between producing interceptors, missile boats, and bombers without any production downtime.

### Light Naval Shipyards

Light Naval Shipyards (designated "L" type) are the shipyard alternative for building small warships. They provide the full shipyard feature set (including refits) within the 1,000-ton envelope.

**Key characteristics:**

| Feature | Light Naval Shipyard |
|---------|---------------------|
| Designation | "L" |
| Cost | Identical to Naval Shipyards |
| Capacity | 1,000 tons per slipway (fixed) |
| Capacity upgrades | Not available |
| Available modifications | Add Slipway, SM Modification only |
| Retooling | Not required |
| Refit capability | Any class to any class at or below 1,000t |
| Build rate | Same as Naval (400 BP/year per slipway base) \hyperlink{ref-9.6-5}{[5]} |

The fixed 1,000-ton capacity cannot be expanded -- this is by design. If you need to build ships larger than 1,000 tons, use a standard Naval Shipyard.

**Refit flexibility:**

Light Naval Shipyards can refit between any two classes at or below 1,000 tons without retooling. The size-difference cost still applies (refitting a 300-ton interceptor to a 900-ton bomber costs proportionally more than refitting between two similar-sized designs), but no retooling time is wasted.

**When to use Light Naval Shipyards vs. Light Naval Factories:**

| Scenario | Preferred Method |
|----------|-----------------|
| Mass production of new fighters | Light Naval Factories (faster, cheaper) |
| Refitting existing small ships | Light Naval Shipyards (refit capability) |
| Building one-off prototypes | Light Naval Shipyards |
| Rapid wartime production | Light Naval Factories (no shipyard queue contention) |
| Post-battle repair of small ships | Repair Yards or Light Naval Shipyards |

> **Tip:** Invest in Light Naval Factory capacity early if you plan a carrier-based doctrine. Factories can produce fighters far faster than shipyards, and the lack of retooling means you can immediately switch to building a new design when technology improves. Reserve your Light Naval Shipyards for refits of existing hulls.

## 9.6.3 Squadron Organization

Light Naval vessels operate in squadrons -- organizational units that group multiple small ships under unified command. Squadrons can operate independently or be assigned to a mothership for parasite operations.

### Squadron Structure

Squadrons are task groups composed exclusively (or primarily) of Light Naval vessels. They function identically to any other task group in Aurora's fleet organization system but are typically:

- Composed of 4-12 ships of the same or similar class
- Assigned a single squadron commander (rated on Light Tactical bonus)
- Either independent or attached to a mothership carrier

### Mothership Assignment

Light Naval vessels can be assigned to a specific mothership -- a larger carrier or tender equipped with hangars. The mothership assignment creates a formal relationship:

- Assigned ships display their mothership in the ship design display tab and Fleet tab
- The mothership's commander provides Carrier Operations bonuses to all assigned parasites
- Strike group achievements are tracked separately with an "(SG)" suffix for the mothership (see [Section 16.2.7 Ship Achievements](../16-commanders/16.2-skills-and-bonuses.md))

### Parasite Operations

Ships assigned to a mothership can execute parasite operations:

- **Land on Assigned Mothership:** Standard landing order; ships dock in the carrier's hangars
- **Land on Assigned Mothership as Sub-Fleet (v1.10+):** Preserves fleet identity by forming a named sub-fleet within the carrier fleet (e.g., "Squadron 01" becomes a sub-fleet named "Squadron 01")
- **Launch:** Ships are deployed from hangars back into space as an independent task group

When docked in hangars, parasites benefit from:

- Maintenance suspension (no malfunction rolls)
- Automated refueling from the mothership's fuel reserves
- Automated MSP resupply (10 MSP/hour conventional, 20 MSP/hour TN) *(unverified -- rates reported by players but not confirmed in game database)*
- Automated ordnance resupply from mothership magazines
- Armor repair by the mothership's damage control teams
- Deployment clock reduction based on mothership deployment status

### Automated Parasite Assignment (v1.13+)

The Shipyard tab of the Economics window provides automated assignment of parasites to newly constructed carriers:

1. Select a fleet as the source of parasites for a population
2. When a new carrier with a designated strikegroup is completed, the system creates a squadron named after the ship with "Strikegroup" appended
3. Parasites from the source fleet are automatically assigned and landed
4. Partial strikegroups are assigned if the full complement is unavailable

### Nesting Restriction

Ships carried inside a hangar cannot themselves carry ships in their own hangars. A Light Naval vessel with its own hangar must empty that hangar before it can land inside a mothership.

> **See also:** [Section 9.3 Task Groups](9.3-task-groups.md) -- Task group organization and movement; [Section 9.4 Fleet Organization](9.4-fleet-organization.md) -- Fleet hierarchy and sub-fleets; [Section 8.6.3 Hangars](../8-ship-design/8.6-other-components.md) -- Hangar mechanics and parasite craft.

## 9.6.4 Carrier Operations

Carrier operations encompass the launch, recovery, maintenance, and resupply of Light Naval vessels aboard motherships. Effective carrier doctrine requires understanding hangar mechanics, transfer rates, and the Carrier Operations commander bonus.

### Hangar Mechanics

Carriers house Light Naval vessels in hangar bays. Three hangar component types are available:

| Type | Size (tons) | Capacity (tons) | Cost (BP) | Crew | Ref |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|------|-----|
| Small Boat Bay | 52.5 | 50 | 5 | 1 | \hyperlink{ref-9.6-1}{[1]} |
| Boat Bay | 262.5 | 250 | 25 | 3 | \hyperlink{ref-9.6-1}{[1]} |
| Hangar Deck | 1,050 | 1,000 | 100 | 12 | \hyperlink{ref-9.6-1}{[1]} |
| Commercial Hangar Deck | 1,600 | 1,000 | 100 | 15 | \hyperlink{ref-9.6-1}{[1]} |

Small Boat Bays, Boat Bays, and Hangar Decks are each 5% larger than their stated capacity \hyperlink{ref-9.6-1}{[1]} (e.g., a 250-ton Boat Bay occupies 262.5 tons) to account for structural support mechanisms. The Commercial Hangar Deck has 60% overhead (1,600 tons for 1,000-ton capacity). The ship designer automatically adds flight crew berths per hangar bay *(unverified -- the exact number of berths added per bay cannot be confirmed from the database; a Primary Flight Control component exists at 4 HS/200t)* for parasite crew accommodation.

**Choosing the right hangar type:**

- **Small Boat Bay (50t capacity):** Best for dedicated interceptor carriers housing sub-500 ton fighters. The low 52.5-ton footprint per bay allows cramming many bays onto a mid-sized carrier, maximizing squadron count at the expense of individual fighter size. Use these when your doctrine favors numerous small missile fighters over fewer large attack craft.
- **Boat Bay (250t capacity):** The general-purpose choice for most carrier designs. Houses the full range of common Light Naval designs (missile boats, beam fighters, patrol craft) without excessive overhead. A 10,000-ton carrier with four boat bays can support a mixed air wing of sixteen 250-ton fighters or fewer larger designs.
- **Hangar Deck (1,000t capacity):** Required for carrying maximum-size Light Naval vessels (patrol corvettes, heavy missile boats at 900-1,000 tons). The 1,050-ton component size means each hangar deck is a significant investment; use these on dedicated fleet carriers of 15,000+ tons that need to support heavy strike craft.
- **Commercial Hangar Deck (1,000t capacity):** A non-military hangar component with the same 1,000-ton capacity as the standard Hangar Deck but at 1,600 tons of hull space (60% overhead vs. 5%) and 15 crew \hyperlink{ref-9.6-1}{[1]}. Because it is classified as a non-military system, it can be fitted to commercial vessels. The higher overhead and crew cost make this appropriate for commercial tenders and support ships rather than dedicated military carriers.

> **Tip:** Match hangar type to your largest intended parasite. A carrier with Boat Bays cannot recover a 600-ton missile boat -- it exceeds the 250-ton capacity. When in doubt, size up: one Hangar Deck provides more flexibility than four Small Boat Bays, though at higher per-bay crew cost.

### Launch and Recovery

Launching and recovering parasite craft takes time -- carriers cannot deploy their full complement instantly. The launch/recovery rate depends on:

- Number and size of hangar bays
- Current combat conditions
- Commander skill (Carrier Operations bonus)

Ships must be recovered to hangars for maintenance, refueling, and rearming. Leaving Light Naval vessels deployed indefinitely leads to maintenance failures and fuel exhaustion.

### Fuel, Supply, and Ordnance Transfer Rates

Motherships automatically transfer resources to docked parasites:

| Resource | Base Rate (Conventional) | Base Rate (TN) | Bonus Multiplier |
|----------|--------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Fuel | Standard refueling rate | Standard refueling rate | Carrier Ops bonus |
| MSP (Maintenance) | 10 MSP/hour/ship | 20 MSP/hour/ship | Carrier Ops bonus |
| Ordnance | From mothership magazines | From mothership magazines | Carrier Ops bonus |

Key transfer mechanics:

- The mothership is treated as having a single virtual cargo shuttle bay for hangar resupply
- This virtual shuttle bay works on all parasite vessels simultaneously (not one at a time)
- The mothership can set a minimum supply threshold; parasites will not drain MSP below this value
- All three transfer rates (fuel, MSP, ordnance) are multiplied by the commander's Carrier Operations bonus

### Carrier Operations Bonus

The Carrier Operations bonus (renamed from Fighter Operations as of v1.13) is the primary commander attribute for carrier effectiveness:

- Multiplies fuel transfer rates to hangared parasites
- Multiplies maintenance supply transfer rates
- Multiplies ordnance transfer rates
- **Critical change (v2.8.0):** Ships over 1,000 tons receive only half the Carrier Operations bonus from their commander

This halving means dedicated Light Naval carriers are significantly more efficient at parasite operations than capital ships that happen to carry a few small craft. A commander with 30% Carrier Operations provides the full 30% bonus to a 800-ton escort carrier's parasites, but only 15% to a 15,000-ton battlecruiser's parasites.

### Armor Repair in Hangars

Motherships automatically repair the armor of docked parasites:

- Successful repair restores armor boxes equal to armor strength value
- Repair begins with the most damaged columns first
- No more than one armor point per column is repaired per increment
- Uses the same cost structure and probability as standard component repairs

### Maintenance Suspension

Ships docked in military hangars (including boat bays and hangar decks) receive complete maintenance suspension:

- No malfunction rolls
- No separate maintenance facility requirements
- No maintenance supply consumption while docked
- The carrier's Damage Control rating enhances repair speed for all housed vessels

> **Tip:** Carrier Operations is the single most important commander bonus for carrier captains. A high Carrier Ops rating dramatically reduces turnaround time for parasites between sorties -- faster refueling, faster rearming, faster repair. When selecting carrier commanders, prioritize Carrier Operations above all other bonuses.

> **See also:** [Section 8.6.3 Hangars and Parasite Craft](../8-ship-design/8.6-other-components.md) -- Detailed hangar component specifications; [Section 16.2.1 Skills](../16-commanders/16.2-skills-and-bonuses.md) -- Carrier Operations skill description; [Section 12.3 Missiles](../12-combat/12.3-missiles.md) -- Fighter combat mechanics.

## 9.6.5 Commander Bonuses

The v2.8.0 update restructured how commander bonuses interact with Light Naval vessels. The key changes are the introduction of Light Tactical and the exclusion of standard Tactical from affecting small ships.

### Light Tactical Bonus

Light Tactical is a new commander bonus that exclusively affects Light Naval units (ships of 1,000 tons or less):

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Applies to | Ships of 1,000t or less only |
| Generation chance | 40% (same as Survey; 2x Tactical's 20%) *(unverified -- Light Tactical does not exist in AuroraDB v2.7.1; this is a v2.8.0 addition. Fighter Combat, its predecessor, exists as BonusID=26 \hyperlink{ref-9.6-4}{[4]})* |
| Replaces | Fighter Combat bonus (removed in v2.8.0) |
| Commander assignment | Assigned by Light Tactical rating |
| Experience weighting | Same as Crew Training weighting for warships |

The higher generation chance (40% vs. Tactical's 20%) reflects the game's expectation that many commanders will serve aboard Light Naval vessels. You will find Light Tactical bonuses roughly twice as often as standard Tactical bonuses in your officer corps.

### Tactical Bonus Exclusion

The standard Tactical bonus no longer affects Light Naval units:

- Ships of 1,000 tons or less are **excluded** from Tactical bonus effects
- Ships over 1,000 tons continue to receive Tactical bonus normally
- This creates a clean separation: Light Tactical for small ships, Tactical for large ships

### Experience Weighting

Commander experience gain is weighted toward the bonus most relevant to their current assignment:

- **Light Naval commanders:** Experience weights toward Light Tactical (analogous to how larger warship commanders' experience weights toward Crew Training)
- This means a commander assigned to a Light Naval squadron will develop their Light Tactical skill faster than other skills
- Reassigning a Light Naval commander to a standard warship does not retroactively remove Light Tactical experience gained

### Full vs. Half Bonuses by Ship Size

The following bonuses are applied at full value to Light Naval units but at half value to ships over 1,000 tons:

| Bonus Type | Light Naval (1,000t or less) | Standard Naval (over 1,000t) |
|------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Crew Training | Full | Half |
| Survey | Full | Half |
| Engineering | Full | Half |
| Tactical | N/A (excluded) | Half |
| Light Tactical | Full | N/A (excluded) |
| Carrier Operations | Full | Half |
| Ground Support | Full | Half |

This asymmetry means a skilled commander has proportionally greater impact on a Light Naval vessel than on a capital ship. A 30% Crew Training bonus gives the full 30% to a 900-ton corvette but only 15% to a 5,000-ton destroyer.

> **See also:** [Section 16.2.1 Skills](../16-commanders/16.2-skills-and-bonuses.md) -- Complete skill category descriptions; [Section 16.2.2 Bonus Generation](../16-commanders/16.2-skills-and-bonuses.md) -- Generation chances for all bonus types; [Section 16.2.5 Promotion and Experience](../16-commanders/16.2-skills-and-bonuses.md) -- Experience gain and skill improvement.

## 9.6.6 Design Considerations

Designing effective Light Naval vessels requires different thinking than designing capital ships. The 1,000-ton ceiling forces hard trade-offs that larger ships can avoid through sheer tonnage.

### General Design Principles

**Speed is survival.** Light Naval vessels cannot absorb punishment. Their primary defense is being too fast to hit reliably. Prioritize engine power density over armor thickness.

**Specialize ruthlessly.** A 1,000-ton hull cannot be a jack-of-all-trades. Each design should excel at exactly one role: missile alpha strike, beam attack, interception, reconnaissance, or ground support.

**Depend on the mothership.** Light Naval vessels are not independent combatants for extended operations. Design them around the assumption that a carrier provides fuel, ordnance, maintenance, and repair. Minimize onboard logistics in favor of combat capability.

### Weapons Selection

**Box launchers** are the dominant weapon system for missile-armed Light Naval vessels:

- No magazine required (saves critical tonnage)
- Fire-and-forget: launch full salvo, return to carrier for rearming
- Ordnance reloaded from mothership magazines while docked
- Trade-off: single-salvo capability only; no sustained fire

**Beam weapons** suit close-range attackers:

- Small lasers, particle beams, or plasma carronades
- Require power plants (tonnage cost)
- Provide sustained fire without returning to carrier
- Best for defensive interceptor roles

**Torpedoes (energy torpedoes)** are generally impractical at Light Naval tonnages:

- Energy torpedoes use energy weapon technology for their warhead (no per-shot mineral cost), but the launcher and power requirements are substantial relative to a 1,000-ton hull
- A single torpedo tube plus the power plant to fire it can consume 200-300 tons -- leaving little room for engines, fuel, and crew on a small hull
- At capital ship scale, torpedoes reward patience with high single-shot damage and no magazine explosion risk; at Light Naval scale, box launchers deliver comparable alpha-strike capability at a fraction of the tonnage cost
- The one niche case is a dedicated 900-1,000 ton torpedo boat designed purely around a single shot: maximum speed to close range, fire one torpedo, withdraw. This sacrifices versatility entirely for a guaranteed heavy hit without ammunition dependency

> **Note:** If you want energy-weapon-based ordnance on Light Naval hulls, box launchers firing conventional missiles remain far more tonnage-efficient. Reserve torpedo designs for standard naval vessels of 3,000+ tons where the power and launcher overhead becomes proportionally manageable.

**Fighter Pod Bays** (pre-v2.8.0, now removed for ground support):

- Were more space-efficient than box launchers for pod ordnance
- Required only minimal missile fire control (0.1 HS)
- As of v2.8.0, fighter pods are removed from research and missile design
- Ground support roles for fighters are planned for a future update

Prior to v2.8.0, fighters could execute ground support orders including flak suppression and search-and-destroy missions against surface targets using fighter pods. These orders were removed alongside the fighter pod system itself, as the unified Light Naval classification made the old fighter-specific ground support mechanics obsolete. Currently, orbital bombardment by standard naval vessels (using missiles or energy weapons) remains the only naval method of supporting ground operations; ground unit close air support by Light Naval craft is planned for a future update (see [Section 13.2 Training and Transport](../13-ground-forces/13.2-training-and-transport.md) for current ground support mechanics).

### Sensors

**Minimal sensors** are the norm for Light Naval designs:

- Most fighters rely on their mothership or fleet escorts for targeting data
- Active sensors on small craft broadcast position to the enemy
- Passive sensors (thermal/EM) are lightweight alternatives for reconnaissance roles
- A single squadron scout with active sensors can provide data for the entire group

### Engine Design

**Military engines only.** Light Naval vessels use military-grade engines exclusively for the power density needed at small tonnages.

**Power-to-weight ratio** is the critical metric. Engine size should typically consume 25-40% of hull tonnage for combat vessels, higher for interceptors.

**Fuel efficiency vs. speed:** Higher-efficiency engines extend range but reduce thrust. For carrier-based fighters that operate within range of their mothership, prioritize speed over fuel economy. For independent patrol craft, balance is more important.

### Armor and Protection

**Minimal armor** is typical:

- 1-2 layers of the best available armor technology
- Any hit on a small ship is likely catastrophic regardless of armor depth
- Tonnage spent on armor directly reduces speed and weapon capacity
- Shields are generally impractical at this tonnage (HS cost too high relative to hull size)

### Engineering and Maintenance

**Fighter-sized engineering spaces** (5 tons) \hyperlink{ref-9.6-2}{[2]} are available for Light Naval vessels:

- Sufficient for carrier-based operations where the mothership handles major maintenance
- Independent patrol craft may warrant Tiny (12.5 tons) or Small (25 tons) engineering spaces
- Maintenance Storage Bays are rarely worthwhile at this tonnage

### Fuel Planning

**Keep it minimal for carrier-based designs:**

- Enough fuel for combat maneuvering and transit to/from the engagement zone
- The carrier refuels parasites automatically when docked
- Range is measured in combat hours, not transit days

**Patrol craft need more:**

- If operating independently, size fuel tanks for the intended patrol duration
- Small Craft Refuelling System (v2.0.0) allows mutual refueling between Light Naval vessels
- Only one refuelling system per class design (v2.1.0 restriction)
- Base flow rate of 5,000 litres/hour (upgradeable via technology) \hyperlink{ref-9.6-3}{[3]}; can only refuel ships of 1,000 tons or less

### Common Light Naval Archetypes

| Role | Typical Size | Key Systems | Doctrine |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Missile Fighter | 300-500t | 2-4 box launchers, engine, fuel | Alpha strike, return to carrier |
| Beam Interceptor | 400-600t | 1-2 lasers, BFC, engine | Fleet defense, anti-fighter |
| Missile Boat | 800-1,000t | 4-6 box launchers, sensor, engine | Independent or carrier-based |
| Recon Fighter | 200-400t | Passive sensors, engine, fuel | Forward scouting |
| Patrol Corvette | 900-1,000t | Mixed weapons, sensors, engineering | Independent long-range patrol |
| Fast Attack Craft | 700-1,000t | Beam weapons, BFC, speed | Close-range beam attack |

### Example Design Trade-offs

**500-ton missile fighter:**
- 2 box launchers (size 6 missiles) = ~36 tons ordnance equivalent
- 1 military engine (25-30% of hull) = 125-150 tons
- Fuel tank = 50-100 tons
- Fighter engineering space = 5 tons
- Remaining for: missile fire control, crew space

This design launches two anti-ship missiles and immediately returns to the carrier. Its entire value proposition is concentrated in that one salvo.

**1,000-ton patrol corvette:**
- Mixed beam armament (2 small lasers + PD gauss) = ~100-150 tons
- Fire controls (1 offensive BFC + 1 PD BFC) = ~100 tons
- Military engine (30% of hull) = 300 tons
- Fuel tank (extended range) = 150 tons
- Small engineering space = 25 tons
- Sensors (1 small active, 1 passive thermal) = ~50 tons
- Armor (2 layers) = ~50 tons
- Remaining for: power plant, crew space

This design can operate independently for months, engaging small threats and providing sensor coverage. It sacrifices alpha-strike power for endurance and versatility.

> **Tip:** When designing your first Light Naval vessels, start with a 500-ton missile fighter carrying 2 box launchers. This is the simplest effective design: launch missiles, return to carrier, rearm, repeat. Once you understand carrier operations, branch out into beam fighters for defense and larger FAC-weight missile boats for heavier salvos. Avoid the temptation to cram too much onto a small hull -- a 1,000-ton ship that tries to do everything will do nothing well.

## 9.6.7 Independent Light Naval Operations

While Light Naval vessels are often designed around carrier dependency, the 1,000-ton ceiling permits viable independent operations for patrol, picket, and reconnaissance roles. Independent Light Naval operations require different design priorities and standing order configurations than carrier-based doctrine.

### Patrol Cycle Management

Independent Light Naval squadrons require structured patrol cycles to maintain continuous coverage without burning out crews or exhausting fuel:

- **Rotation scheduling:** Divide your patrol force into at least three echelons -- one on-station, one in transit, one at base for maintenance and crew rest. This ensures continuous coverage even when individual squadrons return for resupply.
- **Fuel stop planning:** Identify refueling points along patrol routes. These may be colonies with fuel stockpiles, dedicated fuel depots, or tanker ships stationed at waypoints. The Small Craft Refuelling System (v2.0.0) allows Light Naval vessels to refuel each other, enabling buddy-tanking arrangements where a fuel-heavy tender accompanies patrol groups.
- **Patrol duration:** Size fuel tanks for the intended patrol leg plus a 20-30% reserve. A 1,000-ton patrol corvette with 150 tons of fuel at moderate speed can typically sustain 30-60 days of patrol depending on engine efficiency. Plan rotation cycles around this endurance window.

> **Warning:** Light Naval vessels have minimal maintenance storage. Extended independent deployments beyond 90 days risk maintenance failures even if fuel remains sufficient. Plan rotation cycles that return ships to a maintenance facility (colony, carrier, or repair ship) before engineering reliability degrades.

### Independent Sensor Deployment and Picket Lines

Light Naval vessels excel as forward sensor platforms due to their low signature and expendable nature:

- **Picket line formation:** Deploy individual ships or pairs at intervals along likely approach vectors. Spacing should match sensor range -- each picket's detection envelope should overlap its neighbors' by at least 20% to prevent gaps.
- **Passive vs. active:** Picket ships should operate on passive sensors (thermal/EM detection) to avoid broadcasting their position. Reserve active sensor use for confirmed contacts requiring precise range data.
- **Scout-in-depth:** Position picket lines in layers. The outermost line detects; the middle line classifies; the innermost line reports to the main fleet. This provides early warning while limiting the information an approaching enemy can gather from destroying a single picket.
- **Sensor design for pickets:** A dedicated picket ship should mount the best available passive sensors (thermal and EM) at the expense of weapons. A 400-ton reconnaissance fighter with large passive sensors and maximum speed provides better coverage than a 1,000-ton corvette split between sensors and weapons.

### Fuel Self-Sufficiency Design Considerations

Independent Light Naval vessels must carry their own logistics, unlike carrier-based designs that minimize onboard fuel:

| Design Priority | Carrier-Based | Independent |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Fuel allocation | 5-10% of hull | 15-25% of hull |
| Engineering space | Fighter (5t) | Small (25t) or Tiny (12.5t) |
| Endurance target | Hours of combat | Weeks of patrol |
| Refueling method | Mothership automatic | Fuel depots, buddy-tanking |
| Maintenance plan | Carrier repair | Self-sufficient or scheduled returns |

The Small Craft Refuelling System (base 5,000 litres/hour \hyperlink{ref-9.6-3}{[3]}, one system per class) enables mutual refueling between Light Naval vessels, but the flow rate is slow compared to standard underway replenishment. For extended independent operations, dedicate one ship per squadron as a fuel-heavy "squadron tanker" carrying minimal armament but oversized fuel tanks.

> **Note:** The one-refuelling-system-per-class restriction (v2.1.0) means you cannot stack multiple refuelling systems on a single tanker design. A dedicated 1,000-ton squadron tanker with one refuelling system and 400+ tons of fuel is the practical ceiling for Light Naval logistics.

### Coordination with Larger Fleet Units

Independent Light Naval squadrons operating ahead of or alongside a main fleet require clear coordination procedures:

- **Contact reporting:** Pickets and patrol craft should report contacts immediately via the fleet communication chain. In Aurora, this means the task group detecting the contact generates an event; ensure your fleet organization places patrol squadrons under the same fleet command as the main body so contact events propagate.
- **Retreat protocols:** Light Naval vessels cannot survive engagement with capital ships. Standing orders should specify withdrawal triggers: retreat to the escort screen when contacts exceed a tonnage threshold or when hostile active sensors lock the picket.
- **Screening distance:** Position independent Light Naval groups 2-4 sensor range increments ahead of the main fleet. Too close and they provide no early warning; too far and the main fleet cannot respond before the pickets are destroyed.
- **Rally points:** Designate specific coordinates or orbital bodies as rally points where scattered pickets reform after contact. This prevents individual ships from attempting to rejoin the fleet through hostile space.

### Standing Order Configurations for Autonomous Patrol

Aurora's conditional order system allows Light Naval squadrons to operate autonomously with minimal micromanagement:

- **Patrol waypoints:** Set a series of movement orders with "Cycle at End" to create a repeating patrol loop. The squadron automatically traverses the route indefinitely until given new orders.
- **Conditional fuel threshold:** Configure an order to return to base when fuel drops below a specified percentage (typically 30-40%). This prevents squadrons from running dry on distant patrol legs.
- **Contact response:** Use conditional orders to specify behavior on detecting hostiles -- options include maintaining course and reporting, retreating to a designated rally point, or closing to sensor range for classification before withdrawing.
- **Engagement restrictions:** For patrol craft with weapons, standing orders can restrict engagement to targets below a specified tonnage. This prevents a 1,000-ton corvette from engaging a 20,000-ton cruiser on its own initiative.

> **Tip:** The most effective independent Light Naval doctrine combines a sensor-heavy picket line with a reaction force of armed patrol corvettes stationed at a central rally point. Pickets detect and classify; the reaction force responds to confirmed threats within its capability envelope. Anything beyond the reaction force's capability triggers a fleet-level response from the main body.

## 9.6.8 Light Naval Combat Doctrine

Light Naval vessels fight fundamentally differently from capital ships. Their limited endurance, fragile hulls, and reliance on carrier support create a distinct tactical cycle. This section provides a brief doctrinal overview; for detailed combat mechanics see [Section 12.3 Missiles](../12-combat/12.3-missiles.md).

### Alpha Strike and Withdrawal Cycle

The dominant Light Naval combat pattern is the alpha strike: launch full ordnance, withdraw to the carrier, rearm, and repeat. This cycle drives both ship design and tactical planning.

**Typical missile fighter sortie:**

1. **Launch** from carrier at maximum speed toward the target
2. **Close** to missile range (determined by missile speed and endurance)
3. **Fire** all box launchers simultaneously for maximum salvo weight
4. **Withdraw** immediately to the carrier at maximum speed
5. **Land**, rearm from mothership magazines, refuel
6. **Repeat** until the target is destroyed or carrier ordnance is exhausted

The time between sorties depends on the carrier's resupply rates, which are multiplied by the carrier commander's Carrier Operations bonus (see [Section 9.6.4 Carrier Operations](9.6-light-naval-operations.md)).

### Squadron Coordination

Effective Light Naval combat requires coordinating multiple squadrons to overwhelm point defense:

- **Salvo concentration:** Time multiple squadrons to fire simultaneously, creating salvos that exceed the target's point defense capacity
- **Staggered attacks:** Alternate squadrons in waves so that while one attacks, another rearms, maintaining continuous pressure
- **Mixed roles:** Combine missile squadrons (offensive) with beam interceptor squadrons (defensive) for a balanced air wing

### Light Tactical Bonus in Combat

The Light Tactical bonus *(v2.8.0)* directly affects combat performance for Light Naval vessels. Standard Tactical bonus does not apply to ships of 1,000 tons or less -- only Light Tactical matters. A squadron commander with a high Light Tactical bonus provides measurable advantages in hit probability and engagement outcomes. See [Section 9.6.5 Commander Bonuses](9.6-light-naval-operations.md) for the full bonus structure.

### Anti-Fighter Defense

Defending against Light Naval attacks requires point defense systems designed for high-volume, small-target engagements:

- **CIWS (Close-In Weapons Systems):** Gauss cannons provide automated point defense against incoming fighters and missiles
- **Area defense fire controls:** Beam fire controls set to "Final Defensive Fire" engage incoming Light Naval craft at close range
- **Screening escorts:** Fast destroyers with point defense weapons positioned between the carrier group and threat axis

> **Tip:** When planning Light Naval strikes, calculate whether your combined salvo can overwhelm the target's point defense. A single squadron of 4 missile fighters launching 8 missiles may be entirely stopped by a cruiser's CIWS. Two squadrons launching 16 missiles simultaneously are far more likely to score hits. Coordinate your waves.
