# 9.4 Fleet Organization

As your empire expands and your navy grows from a handful of survey ships to dozens or hundreds of vessels, proper fleet organization becomes essential. Aurora C# provides a hierarchical structure for organizing your ships, from individual vessels up to entire fleets. This section covers how to structure your forces for maximum effectiveness.

## 9.4.1 Fleet Hierarchy

Aurora C# organizes naval forces in a multi-level hierarchy:

**Fleet:** The highest organizational level. A fleet is a named collection of task groups that share a common strategic purpose. Examples include "Home Fleet," "3rd Expeditionary Fleet," or "Sol Defense Force." Fleets are primarily an organizational convenience -- they help you keep track of which groups serve which purpose.

**Task Group:** The operational unit (covered in detail in Section 9.3). Task groups receive movement and combat orders directly. Multiple task groups can belong to the same fleet.

**Ships:** Individual vessels assigned to task groups. Ships cannot operate independently -- they must belong to a task group, even if it is a group of one.

**Creating and Managing Fleets:**
1. Open the Naval Organization window (F12)
2. Create a new fleet and assign it a name
3. Assign existing task groups to the fleet
4. Optionally assign a Fleet Commander (an admiral-rank officer)

**Fleet Commanders:** Assigning a senior officer as fleet commander provides bonuses that cascade to all task groups within the fleet:
- Fleet-wide coordination bonuses during combat
- Improved response times to new contacts
- Training benefits for subordinate officers
- The fleet commander's rank should be appropriate to the fleet size

**Organizational Principles:**

*By Mission:*
- Exploration Fleet (survey groups, scout groups)
- Defense Fleet (system defense ships, orbital platforms)
- Strike Fleet (offensive combat groups)
- Logistics Fleet (transports, tankers, tenders)

*By Region:*
- Home Fleet (Sol or capital system)
- Sector Fleets (one per major operational area)
- Frontier Fleet (border patrol and response)

*By Composition:*
- Carrier Battle Groups (carriers + escorts)
- Cruiser Squadrons (homogeneous cruiser groups)
- Destroyer Flotillas (fast attack groups)
- Patrol Forces (light, fast picket groups)

> **Tip:** Name your fleets consistently and meaningfully. When managing 50+ task groups across multiple systems, clear names like "Alpha Centauri Patrol Group 2" save time compared to generic names like "Task Group 47."

## 9.4.2 Detaching and Merging

The ability to split and combine task groups dynamically is a core tactical and logistical capability.

**Detaching Ships:**
1. Select the task group containing the ship(s) you want to detach
2. In the Naval Organization window, select the specific ships
3. Choose "Detach" to form them into a new task group, or "Transfer" to move them to an existing group in the same location

**When to Detach:**
- A damaged ship needs to return to base for repairs while the fleet continues operating
- A tanker has finished refueling the fleet and needs to return for more fuel
- A fast scout needs to investigate a contact while the main body holds position
- You want to split forces for a pincer maneuver

**Merging Task Groups:**
1. Both task groups must be at the same location (same coordinates in space)
2. Select the groups in the Naval Organization window
3. Choose "Merge" to combine them into a single task group

**When to Merge:**
- Reinforcements have arrived to join the main fleet
- Multiple patrol groups are concentrating for a major operation
- Transport groups are combining for a convoy

**Important Constraints:**
- Ships can only be transferred between groups that are at the same location
- Detaching or merging while in transit will cause the groups to stop at their current position
- The merged group's speed will be limited to the slowest ship in the combined group
- Orders assigned to the original groups are lost when merging -- you must reassign orders to the new combined group

**Split Operations:** For combat situations, you might pre-plan splits by organizing your task group with future detachment in mind. For example, keep your missile ships and beam ships in the same group for transit, but plan to detach the beam group for close engagement while the missile group provides standoff fire.

> **Tip:** Before a major operation, rehearse your planned detachments mentally. Which ships go where? What orders does each sub-group get? Having this planned in advance means you can execute splits quickly when the tactical situation demands it.

> **Tip:** When detaching a single ship (e.g., a damaged vessel), remember it becomes its own one-ship task group and needs its own orders. Forgetting to order a detached ship home is a common mistake that leaves cripples drifting in space.

## 9.4.3 Naming Conventions

Aurora C# supports both automatic and custom naming for ships, task groups, and fleets. Good naming practices become essential as your navy grows.

**Ship Names:** Individual ships are named when they complete construction. The game can auto-generate names from a list based on the ship class's hull type, or you can assign custom names.

**Class-Based Naming:** Each ship class can be associated with a name theme. For example:
- Battleships might draw from historical admirals
- Destroyers from weather phenomena
- Carriers from famous battles
- Survey ships from explorers

You can edit the name lists in the game to add your preferred names. Ships are drawn from the list in order as they are built.

**Task Group Names:** Task groups can be given any name you choose. Common conventions include:
- **Functional:** "Survey Group Alpha," "Transport Convoy 3," "Fuel Tanker Run"
- **Military:** "1st Destroyer Squadron," "Carrier Battle Group 2," "Patrol Force Charlie"
- **Geographic:** "Alpha Centauri Defense Group," "Ross 128 Picket"
- **Numbered:** Simple sequential numbering for large forces

**Fleet Names:** Fleets typically receive grand names reflecting their purpose or area of operations:
- "Home Fleet" -- Primary defense force
- "Grand Fleet" -- Main offensive force
- "5th Fleet" -- Numbered fleet designation
- "Frontier Command" -- Border patrol and response force

**Renaming:** All organizational elements can be renamed at any time through the Naval Organization window. Renaming has no gameplay effect but significantly impacts your ability to manage a large navy.

**Naming Best Practices:**
- Include the mission type in task group names (Survey, Patrol, Combat, Transport)
- Use consistent numbering schemes across similar groups
- Update names when a group's mission changes
- Consider including the system name for groups with permanent station assignments

> **Tip:** Develop a personal naming convention early and stick with it. When you have 30+ task groups across 10 star systems, consistent naming is the difference between efficient management and chaos.

> **Tip:** Some players use prefixes to indicate group composition at a glance: "DD-" for destroyer groups, "CA-" for cruiser groups, "CV-" for carrier groups, and "TF-" for mixed task forces. This allows quick identification in the task group dropdown lists.
