# 9.3 Task Groups

Task Groups are the fundamental organizational unit for moving and commanding ships in Aurora C#. Every ship in space belongs to a task group, and all movement and standing orders are issued at the task group level, not to individual ships. Understanding task group mechanics is essential for effective fleet operations.

Task groups are managed through the **Naval Organization** window (F12) and the **Task Group** window, which is your primary interface for issuing orders.

## 9.3.1 Creating Task Groups

**Formation:** A new task group is created by selecting one or more ships and forming them into a group. This can be done from the Naval Organization window by:

1. Opening the Naval Organization window (F12)
2. Selecting the ships you want to group (from the available ships list or by detaching from existing groups)
3. Clicking "Create Task Group" and assigning a name

Alternatively, ships completing construction at a colony are automatically placed into a default task group (or can be assigned to an existing group in orbit).

**Composition Considerations:**
- Task groups can contain any mix of ship types and sizes
- There is no hard limit on the number of ships in a task group
- All ships in a task group share the same movement orders and destination
- Ships within a task group can have different combat orders (see Section 9.5)

**Commanders:** Each task group should have a commanding officer assigned. The commander's skills affect the task group's performance:

- **Initiative** -- Affects how quickly the task group responds to contact
- **Navigation** -- Reduces transit time and improves pathfinding
- **Training** -- Improves crew performance over time
- **Logistics** -- Affects efficiency of loading/unloading operations

Officers are assigned from your officer pool through the Naval Organization window. A task group without a commander operates at reduced effectiveness.

**Standard Task Group Types:**
- **Combat Group** -- Warships organized for battle (escorts, capital ships)
- **Survey Group** -- Survey vessels assigned to explore systems
- **Transport Group** -- Freighters and colony ships moving cargo/population
- **Logistics Group** -- Tankers and supply ships supporting other groups
- **Patrol Group** -- Fast ships assigned to monitor an area

> **Tip:** Keep your combat task groups homogeneous in speed. A fast escort group paired with slow battleships creates a group that moves at battleship speed, negating the escorts' speed advantage. Form separate fast and slow groups that can coordinate tactically.

## 9.3.2 Task Group Speed

The speed of a task group is determined by its **slowest member**. This is one of the most important constraints in fleet management.

**Speed Calculation:** Each ship's maximum speed is determined by its engine power divided by its total mass (including fuel, cargo, and any other loaded weight). The task group's speed equals the minimum of all member ships' speeds.

**Implications:**
- Adding a single slow ship to a fast task group reduces the entire group's speed
- Cargo-laden freighters are typically much slower than warships
- Ships low on fuel weigh less and may actually be slightly faster (but risk running out of fuel)
- Damaged engines reduce a ship's speed, which can slow the entire group

**Speed and Fuel Consumption:** Ships in a task group all travel at the group's speed, not their individual maximum speeds. Ships capable of higher speeds that are throttled down to match the group consume less fuel per distance traveled than at their maximum speed. Fuel consumption is proportional to speed.

**Maximum Speed Display:** The Task Group window displays both the task group's current maximum speed (limited by the slowest ship) and the speeds of individual members, allowing you to identify which ship is the bottleneck.

> **Tip:** If a damaged ship is slowing your combat group during a retreat, consider detaching it. One sacrificed cripple is better than losing the entire fleet because it could not outrun the enemy.

> **Tip:** Design your fleet with speed tiers in mind. If your destroyers do 5,000 km/s and your cruisers do 3,500 km/s, form separate task groups that can operate independently or combine at the slower speed when concentrated force is needed.

## 9.3.3 Conditional Orders

Conditional orders allow task groups to respond automatically to changing circumstances without player intervention. These are critical for managing a large empire where you cannot micromanage every fleet movement.

**Setting Conditional Orders:** In the Task Group window, the orders list supports conditional logic. You can set orders that trigger based on specific conditions:

**Available Conditions:**
- **Fuel Level** -- Execute order when fuel drops below a threshold (e.g., "if fuel < 25%, move to nearest fuel depot")
- **Ammunition** -- Execute order when ordnance is depleted or below a threshold
- **Shield Status** -- Respond to shield damage
- **Contacts** -- React to detected enemy contacts (requires sensors)
- **Order Completion** -- Chain orders sequentially (proceed to next order when current completes)
- **Target Destroyed** -- Move to next target after current is eliminated

**Standing Orders:** These are persistent instructions that remain in effect regardless of other orders:
- **Avoid Enemy Contacts** -- Task group will alter course to evade detected hostiles
- **Engage at Will** -- Task group will fire on detected enemies within range
- **Maintain Distance** -- Keep a specified distance from contacts

**Order Loops:** You can create patrol loops by setting a series of waypoint orders that cycle. When the final order completes, the group returns to the first order in the sequence, creating an indefinite patrol pattern.

**Sub-Pulse Order Processing:** Aurora C# processes orders within each time increment. Conditional orders are evaluated at each sub-pulse, meaning a task group can detect a threat and respond within the same 5-second increment (the smallest time unit).

> **Tip:** Always set a "low fuel" conditional order on your combat groups. A fleet that runs out of fuel in enemy territory is a dead fleet. Setting an automatic return-to-base at 20-30% fuel ensures you always have enough to get home.

> **Tip:** For survey ships, set conditional orders to return to base when fuel drops below 40-50% (they need margin for the survey process, which involves frequent course changes that consume extra fuel).

> **Tip:** Conditional orders are evaluated in priority order. Place safety-critical conditions (low fuel, enemy contact evasion) above routine orders so they take precedence.
