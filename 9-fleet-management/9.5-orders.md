# 9.5 Orders

Orders are how you direct your task groups to accomplish objectives. Aurora C# provides a comprehensive order system ranging from simple movement commands to complex conditional behavior chains. Mastering the order system is key to running an efficient empire, especially as your navy grows beyond what you can manually direct each increment.

Orders are issued through the **Task Group** window, which displays the selected group's current order queue and provides controls for adding, removing, and reordering instructions.

## 9.5.1 Movement Orders

Movement orders direct a task group to travel to a specific location. These are the most commonly issued orders and form the backbone of all fleet operations.

**Move To:** The basic movement order. Directs the task group to travel in a straight line to a destination at its maximum speed. Destinations can include:
- A specific body (planet, moon, asteroid)
- A colony
- A jump point
- Another task group's current position
- A waypoint (see Section 10.4)
- Specific coordinates in a star system

**Orbit:** Directs the task group to take up orbit around a celestial body. This is distinct from merely moving to the body's location -- orbiting establishes the group in a stable position relative to the body, which is required for certain operations like loading cargo at a colony or conducting orbital surveys.

**Patrol:** Establishes a repeating movement pattern between two or more waypoints. The task group moves to each waypoint in sequence, then loops back to the first. Patrol orders continue indefinitely until canceled or superseded by a conditional trigger.

**Follow:** Commands the task group to match position with another specified task group, maintaining formation as the lead group moves. Useful for logistics ships trailing a combat fleet or escorts shadowing a high-value target.

**Move to Contact:** Directs the group toward a detected sensor contact. The task group will continue to close with the contact, updating its course as the contact moves.

**Intercept:** A specialized movement order that calculates an intercept course with a moving target, plotting the shortest path to a meeting point rather than chasing directly. More fuel-efficient than "Move to Contact" when the target is moving at an angle.

> **Tip:** Use "Orbit" rather than "Move To" when you want ships to remain at a colony. "Move To" merely brings the group to the location; it does not establish the stable orbital relationship needed for cargo operations.

> **Tip:** When plotting movements across a system, remember that all movement is in straight lines. There is no pathfinding around obstacles. If a direct path takes your ships dangerously close to a hostile force, set intermediate waypoints to route around them.

## 9.5.2 Combat Orders

Combat orders govern how a task group behaves when engaging hostile forces. These orders can be set as standing doctrine or issued in response to specific tactical situations.

**Engage Target:** Directs the task group to attack a specific target or the nearest hostile contact. The group will close to weapons range and fire.

**Engage at Will:** A standing order that allows the task group to fire on any hostile contact within range without specific player direction. Essential for defensive groups that may encounter threats when you are not watching.

**Evade:** Directs the task group to flee from the nearest hostile contact at maximum speed. The group will attempt to open distance, changing course as needed to stay away from pursuers.

**Distance Settings:** You can specify engagement ranges:
- **Close to X km** -- Move within a specified distance before engaging
- **Maintain X km** -- Attempt to keep a specified distance while firing (stand-off engagement)
- **Open to X km** -- Disengage and open distance to at least X km

**Fire Control Assignment:** Within a task group, individual ships can be assigned specific fire control priorities:
- Target type priorities (prioritize military over civilian, or specific hull sizes)
- Weapon assignment (which weapons fire at which targets)
- Point defense settings (allocate some weapons to missile defense)

**Pursuit Orders:** Determines whether the task group will chase fleeing enemies:
- **Pursue** -- Follow retreating enemies until destroyed or out of sensor range
- **Do Not Pursue** -- Hold position after the enemy breaks contact
- **Pursue to X km** -- Chase enemies but stop at a maximum distance from the original position

**Formation:** Task groups can be set to maintain combat formation:
- Ships maintain relative positions during engagement
- Formation discipline affects how quickly the group can concentrate fire
- Faster ships in a mixed group can be set to screen ahead of slower capitals

> **Tip:** Set "Maintain Distance" orders for missile ships so they stay at standoff range rather than closing to point-blank. Beam ships should "Close to" their optimal range. This creates a layered engagement where missiles soften targets before beam ships close.

> **Tip:** Always set "Evade" as a conditional order triggered by shield/armor damage thresholds on valuable ships. An admiral who fights to the death is admirable in fiction but wasteful in Aurora.

## 9.5.3 Logistics Orders

Logistics orders handle the movement of cargo, fuel, troops, and colonists. These orders are essential for maintaining your empire's supply chains and expanding to new worlds.

**Load Cargo:** Directs the task group to load specific cargo types from the colony it is orbiting:
- Minerals (specific types or all available)
- Installations (factories, mines, infrastructure)
- Ground forces (army units)
- Population (for colony ships)

Loading takes time proportional to the amount loaded and the ship's cargo handling equipment.

**Unload Cargo:** The reverse of loading -- deposits cargo at the current colony. Unloading is generally faster than loading.

**Refuel at Colony:** Tops off the task group's fuel tanks from the colony's fuel stockpile. This is one of the most frequently used logistics orders.

**Refuel from Tanker:** Transfers fuel from a tanker ship to other ships in the group, or between task groups at the same location.

**Load Ordnance:** Replenishes missile magazines and ammunition from the colony's ordnance stockpile. Critical for missile-heavy fleets that expend ammunition in combat.

**Auto-Route:** A powerful automation order for transport groups. When set, the task group will automatically shuttle between two colonies, loading at one and unloading at the other, based on the colonies' needs and available cargo.

**Colony Orders:** Specialized logistics orders for colony ships:
- **Load Colonists** -- Fill the colony ship with population from the current colony
- **Unload Colonists** -- Deposit colonists at the destination (establishes a new colony if none exists)

**Standing Logistics Orders:**
- **Repeat Orders** -- Cycle through the order queue indefinitely (load, travel, unload, return, repeat)
- **Until Complete** -- Continue cycling until no more cargo is available to move
- **Single Run** -- Execute the order queue once, then stop

> **Tip:** Set up automated "Repeat Orders" cargo runs early in the game for critical mineral routes. A pair of freighters on auto-repeat between your mining colony and your home world provides a steady mineral supply without requiring your attention every few days.

> **Tip:** Keep a dedicated tanker group near your main fleet's operating area. Combat ships with nearly empty tanks after a battle need rapid refueling, and waiting for a tanker to arrive from the home system could leave your fleet vulnerable.

## 9.5.4 Conditional Orders

Conditional orders add intelligence to your task groups by allowing them to make decisions based on game state. This section expands on the conditional order concepts introduced in Section 9.3.3 with detailed examples of complex order chains.

**Order Structure:** Each order in the queue can have a condition attached. The basic structure is:
- **IF** [condition] **THEN** [execute this order]
- If the condition is not met, the order is skipped and the next order in the queue is evaluated

**Condition Types:**

*Resource Conditions:*
- Fuel percentage (above/below threshold)
- Ordnance percentage
- Cargo capacity (full/empty/percentage)
- Maintenance supplies

*Contact Conditions:*
- Hostile contact detected within X km
- No hostile contacts detected
- Specific contact type detected (military, civilian, unknown)
- Number of contacts exceeds threshold

*Status Conditions:*
- Ship damage above threshold
- Crew grade below threshold
- Shield percentage below threshold
- Speed reduced below threshold

*Time/Location Conditions:*
- Arrived at destination
- Time elapsed since last order
- Within X km of specified location

**Complex Order Chains Example -- Combat Patrol:**
1. Move to Waypoint Alpha
2. IF hostile contact detected within 200M km: Move to contact
3. IF hostile contact detected within 200M km: Engage at will
4. IF fuel below 30%: Move to nearest colony with fuel
5. IF fuel below 30%: Refuel at colony
6. IF fuel below 30%: Return to Waypoint Alpha
7. Move to Waypoint Beta (loops back to order 1)

**Complex Order Chains Example -- Supply Run:**
1. Orbit colony Alpha
2. Load cargo (minerals)
3. IF cargo hold full OR no more cargo available: Move to colony Beta
4. Orbit colony Beta
5. Unload all cargo
6. IF cargo hold empty: Move to colony Alpha
7. (Repeat from order 1)

**Priority and Override:** When multiple conditions are true simultaneously, the highest-priority (earliest in the queue) matching condition takes effect. Place safety conditions before mission conditions to ensure fleet survival takes priority over mission completion.

**Default Orders:** If no conditions match, the task group executes the first unconditional order in its queue. If the queue is empty or all orders are conditional with unmet conditions, the task group holds position.

> **Tip:** Build a library of standard order templates mentally. For example, every combat group should have a "damage/fuel retreat" template: IF shields below 25% OR fuel below 20%, disengage and move to nearest friendly colony.

> **Tip:** Test your conditional order chains with small time increments before fast-forwarding. A logic error in a conditional chain can send your fleet on unexpected paths. Step through a few 5-day increments to verify the group behaves as intended.

> **Tip:** Remember that conditional orders only trigger if the group has the sensors to detect the condition. A group without active sensors cannot trigger "hostile contact detected" conditions based on its own detection -- it would need another group to relay the contact.
