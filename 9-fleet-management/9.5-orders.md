# 9.5 Orders

Orders are how you direct your task groups to accomplish objectives. Aurora C# provides a comprehensive order system ranging from simple movement commands to complex conditional behavior chains. Mastering the order system is key to running an efficient empire, especially as your navy grows beyond what you can manually direct each increment.

Orders are issued through the **Task Group** window, which displays the selected group's current order queue and provides controls for adding, removing, and reordering instructions.

## 9.5.1 Movement Orders

Movement orders direct a task group to travel to a specific location. These are the most commonly issued orders and form the backbone of all fleet operations.

**Move To:** The basic movement order. Directs the task group to travel in a straight line to a destination at its maximum speed. Destinations can include:
- A specific body (planet, moon, asteroid)
- A colony
- A jump point
- Another task group's current position
- A waypoint (see Section 10.4)
- Specific coordinates in a star system

**Orbit:** Directs the task group to take up orbit around a celestial body. This is distinct from merely moving to the body's location -- orbiting establishes the group in a stable position relative to the body, which is required for certain operations like loading cargo at a colony or conducting orbital surveys.

**Patrol:** Establishes a repeating movement pattern between two or more waypoints. The task group moves to each waypoint in sequence, then loops back to the first. Patrol orders continue indefinitely until canceled or superseded by a conditional trigger.

**Follow:** Commands the task group to match position with another specified task group, maintaining formation as the lead group moves. Useful for logistics ships trailing a combat fleet or escorts shadowing a high-value target.

**Move to Contact:** Directs the group toward a detected sensor contact. The task group will continue to close with the contact, updating its course as the contact moves.

**Intercept:** A specialized movement order that calculates an intercept course with a moving target, plotting the shortest path to a meeting point rather than chasing directly. More fuel-efficient than "Move to Contact" when the target is moving at an angle.

> **Tip:** Use "Orbit" rather than "Move To" when you want ships to remain at a colony. "Move To" merely brings the group to the location; it does not establish the stable orbital relationship needed for cargo operations.

> **Tip:** When plotting movements across a system, remember that all movement is in straight lines. There is no pathfinding around obstacles. If a direct path takes your ships dangerously close to a hostile force, set intermediate waypoints to route around them.

## 9.5.2 Combat Orders

Combat orders govern how a task group behaves when engaging hostile forces. These orders can be set as standing doctrine or issued in response to specific tactical situations.

**Engage Target:** Directs the task group to attack a specific target or the nearest hostile contact. The group will close to weapons range and fire.

**Engage at Will:** A standing order that allows the task group to fire on any hostile contact within range without specific player direction. Essential for defensive groups that may encounter threats when you are not watching.

**Evade:** Directs the task group to flee from the nearest hostile contact at maximum speed. The group will attempt to open distance, changing course as needed to stay away from pursuers.

**Distance Settings:** You can specify engagement ranges:
- **Close to X km** -- Move within a specified distance before engaging
- **Maintain X km** -- Attempt to keep a specified distance while firing (stand-off engagement)
- **Open to X km** -- Disengage and open distance to at least X km

**Fire Control Assignment:** Within a task group, individual ships can be assigned specific fire control priorities:
- Target type priorities (prioritize military over civilian, or specific hull sizes)
- Weapon assignment (which weapons fire at which targets)
- Point defense settings (allocate some weapons to missile defense)

**Pursuit Orders:** Determines whether the task group will chase fleeing enemies:
- **Pursue** -- Follow retreating enemies until destroyed or out of sensor range
- **Do Not Pursue** -- Hold position after the enemy breaks contact
- **Pursue to X km** -- Chase enemies but stop at a maximum distance from the original position

**Formation:** Task groups can be set to maintain combat formation:
- Ships maintain relative positions during engagement
- Formation discipline affects how quickly the group can concentrate fire
- Faster ships in a mixed group can be set to screen ahead of slower capitals

> **Tip:** Set "Maintain Distance" orders for missile ships so they stay at standoff range rather than closing to point-blank. Beam ships should "Close to" their optimal range. This creates a layered engagement where missiles soften targets before beam ships close.

> **Tip:** Always set "Evade" as a conditional order triggered by shield/armor damage thresholds on valuable ships. An admiral who fights to the death is admirable in fiction but wasteful in Aurora.

## 9.5.3 Logistics Orders

Logistics orders handle the movement of cargo, fuel, troops, and colonists. These orders are essential for maintaining your empire's supply chains and expanding to new worlds.

**Load Cargo:** Directs the task group to load specific cargo types from the colony it is orbiting:
- Minerals (specific types or all available)
- Installations (factories, mines, infrastructure)
- Ground forces (army units)
- Population (for colony ships)

Loading takes time proportional to the amount loaded and the ship's cargo handling equipment.

**Unload Cargo:** The reverse of loading -- deposits cargo at the current colony. Unloading is generally faster than loading.

**Load Ordnance:** Replenishes missile magazines and ammunition from the colony's ordnance stockpile. Critical for missile-heavy fleets that expend ammunition in combat.

**Auto-Route:** A powerful automation order for transport groups. When set, the task group will automatically shuttle between two colonies, loading at one and unloading at the other, based on the colonies' needs and available cargo.

**Colony Orders:** Specialized logistics orders for colony ships:
- **Load Colonists** -- Fill the colony ship with population from the current colony
- **Unload Colonists** -- Deposit colonists at the destination (establishes a new colony if none exists)

**Standing Logistics Orders:**
- **Repeat Orders** -- Cycle through the order queue indefinitely (load, travel, unload, return, repeat)
- **Until Complete** -- Continue cycling until no more cargo is available to move
- **Single Run** -- Execute the order queue once, then stop

### Combination Orders

Combination Orders allow multiple logistics functions to execute simultaneously on ships and fleets, significantly reducing the time required for complex resupply operations. When a combination order is issued, all specified activities happen in parallel, and the order completes when the activity with the greatest duration finishes.

**Available Combination Orders:**
- **Refuel, Resupply, Load Ordnance from Colony** -- Performs all three resupply actions simultaneously at a colony
- **Join, Refuel and Resupply Target Fleet** -- Moves to and joins the target fleet, then refuels and resupplies simultaneously
- **Join, Refuel, Resupply, Add Ordnance to Target Fleet** -- Moves to the target fleet, joins it, and performs all three resupply actions simultaneously

**Key Mechanic:** The completion time of a combination order is determined by whichever individual activity takes longest. For example, if refuelling takes 4 hours and resupply takes 6 hours, the combination order completes in 6 hours (not 10).

### Refuelling System

Refuelling in Aurora C# is no longer instantaneous. Ships require specialized equipment and can only refuel at specific locations and from specific sources. A dedicated technology line ("Refuelling Systems") establishes racial refuelling rates, starting at 50,000 litres per hour and scaling through ten technology tiers up to 500,000 litres per hour.

**Refuelling Infrastructure:**

| Facility | BP Cost | Size/Transport | Notes |
|-----------|---------|----------------|-------|
| Spaceport | 2,400 | Equal to 4 research facilities | Can refuel unlimited simultaneous ships; ships must be stationary; transportable by freighter |
| Refuelling Station | 1,200 | 10 factories (transport size) | Requires no workers; transportable by freighter; no cargo bonuses |
| Refuelling Hub | 2,400 | 100,000 tons (ship component) | Commercial system; mounts on ships; designed for deep-space stations rather than fleet tankers |
| Refuelling System | 10-100 | 500 tons (ship component) | Enables single-ship refuelling from a tanker |

**Underway Replenishment Technology:** Allows refuelling while both vessels are moving together. Starting at 20% of the normal refuelling rate and advancing through technology tiers to reach 100% of normal rate. Without this technology, ships must be stationary to transfer fuel.

**Tanker Status Flags:** Tanker ships can be assigned one of three operational statuses:
- **None** -- No refuelling activity
- **Refuel Fleet** -- Continuously refuels all ships in the parent fleet during normal operations, keeping fuel tanks topped up
- **Refuel Sub-Fleet** -- Refuels only ships within the same sub-fleet hierarchy

**Refuelling Priority System:** When multiple ships need fuel, tankers refuel in descending order of priority:
1. Ship priority (higher numbers serviced first)
2. Class priority (higher numbers serviced first)

Each tanker class has a configurable minimum fuel threshold below which it ceases refuelling other ships (to preserve its own operational reserve). Tankers automatically move between multiple targets if time and fuel permit.

**Refuelling Orders:**

- **Refuel at Colony** -- Refuels from a colony's fuel stockpile; requires the colony to have a spaceport or refuelling station
- **Join & Refuel Fleet** -- The tanker's fleet joins the target fleet and activates "Refuel Fleet" status
- **Join & Refuel Sub-Fleet** -- The tanker's fleet becomes part of the target sub-fleet with "Refuel Sub-Fleet" status activated
- **Refuel from Refuelling Hub** -- Requires a destination fleet containing at least one Refuelling Hub; refuelling continues until tanks are full or hubs deplete; multiple hubs contribute fuel collectively but do not increase the transfer rate
- **Refuel from Colony** -- Available only at colonies with spaceports or refuelling stations; works identically to hub refuelling mechanically
- **Refuel at Hub (Standing Order)** -- A standing order variant that directs a fleet to seek out and refuel from the nearest Refuelling Hub

**Fuel Transfer Orders (for tanker-designated ships):**
- **Transfer Fuel to Colony** -- Transfers fuel to colonies with spaceports or refuelling stations at the tanker's refuelling rate
- **Transfer Fuel to Refuelling Hub** -- Transfers fuel to any ship mounting a hub at the tanker's refuelling rate; multiple tankers can transfer simultaneously

> **Tip:** Set up automated "Repeat Orders" cargo runs early in the game for critical mineral routes. A pair of freighters on auto-repeat between your mining colony and your home world provides a steady mineral supply without requiring your attention every few days.

> **Tip:** Keep a dedicated tanker group near your main fleet's operating area. Combat ships with nearly empty tanks after a battle need rapid refueling, and waiting for a tanker to arrive from the home system could leave your fleet vulnerable.

> **Tip:** Use "Refuel Fleet" status on your tankers rather than issuing individual refuelling orders. This keeps the tanker continuously topping up all ships in the fleet, ensuring everyone stays fueled during extended operations without manual intervention.

> **Tip:** Design dedicated refuelling stations as deep-space fuel depots along major transit routes. Ships with Refuelling Hubs can serve as stationary fuel points, while tankers shuttle fuel from colonies to replenish them.

## 9.5.4 Standing Orders

Standing Orders are the C# equivalent of "Default Orders" from VB6. They represent automatic behavioral instructions that execute when a fleet has no active movement orders. Standing Orders provide persistent, autonomous behavior without requiring the player to queue specific commands.

**Activation Rules:** Standing orders are only checked if the time increment length is greater than one hour. When a vessel has no active movement orders, it executes the Primary Standing Order. If that order is impossible to fulfil, it attempts the Secondary Standing Order.

**Order Scope Indicators:** Each standing order includes an **S** or **A** designation:
- **S (System):** Searches for potential destinations within the current system only
- **A (All Systems):** Searches across all known systems, using pathfinding that accounts for fleet settings

The pathfinding algorithm respects two fleet-level settings (set via the Movement Orders tab checkboxes):
- **Avoid Danger:** The fleet will not travel through any system where the danger rating exceeds the protection value of friendly warships
- **Avoid Alien Systems:** Systems flagged as alien-controlled become inaccessible to pathfinding

**Available Standing Order Types:**

| Order | Scope | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Land on Assigned Mothership | S | Executes only when a common mothership exists for the fleet |
| Move to System Requiring GeoSurvey | S/A | Targets systems lacking the "Standing Order Geo Survey Complete" flag |
| Move to System Requiring GravSurvey | S/A | Targets systems needing gravitational surveys |
| Refuel at Hub | S/A | Navigates to the nearest Refuelling Hub on a stationary vessel |
| Move to Closest Rendezvous Point | S/A | Navigates to the nearest Rendezvous waypoint (see Section 10.4) |
| Investigate Closest Point of Interest | S/A | Visits temporary POI waypoints marking exploration areas |

**Conditional Orders:** These are Standing Orders linked to specific trigger conditions. When the condition is met, the conditional order executes automatically. Secondary conditional orders will not execute if the fleet is already acting on the primary conditional order. This prevents conflicting automated behaviors.

**Points of Interest (POI):** POIs function as temporary waypoints that persist until a fleet arrives at the location or for six months, whichever occurs first. Multiple fleets with the "Investigate Point of Interest" order will coordinate to avoid duplicate investigations. **Urgent Points of Interest** last one year instead of six months and receive priority visitation over standard POIs from fleets with investigation standing orders.

> **Tip:** Set "Move to System Requiring GeoSurvey" as a standing order on dedicated survey fleets. They will autonomously seek out and survey new systems without requiring manual orders each time they complete a survey.

> **Tip:** Use Rendezvous Points as fleet rally locations. Set the standing order on reinforcement ships so they automatically navigate to your fleet's operating area without manual intervention.

## 9.5.5 Conditional Orders

Conditional orders add intelligence to your fleets by allowing them to make decisions based on game state. They work in conjunction with Standing Orders to create sophisticated autonomous behavior.

**Order Structure:** Each order in the queue can have a condition attached. The basic structure is:
- **IF** [condition] **THEN** [execute this order]
- If the condition is not met, the order is skipped and the next order in the queue is evaluated

**Condition Types:**

*Resource Conditions:*
- Fuel percentage (above/below threshold)
- Ordnance percentage
- Cargo capacity (full/empty/percentage)
- Maintenance supplies

*Contact Conditions:*
- Hostile contact detected within X km
- No hostile contacts detected
- Specific contact type detected (military, civilian, unknown)
- Number of contacts exceeds threshold

*Status Conditions:*
- Ship damage above threshold
- Crew grade below threshold
- Shield percentage below threshold
- Speed reduced below threshold

*Time/Location Conditions:*
- Arrived at destination
- Time elapsed since last order
- Within X km of specified location

**Complex Order Chains Example -- Combat Patrol:**
1. Move to Waypoint Alpha
2. IF hostile contact detected within 200M km: Move to contact
3. IF hostile contact detected within 200M km: Engage at will
4. IF fuel below 30%: Move to nearest colony with fuel
5. IF fuel below 30%: Refuel at colony
6. IF fuel below 30%: Return to Waypoint Alpha
7. Move to Waypoint Beta (loops back to order 1)

**Complex Order Chains Example -- Supply Run:**
1. Orbit colony Alpha
2. Load cargo (minerals)
3. IF cargo hold full OR no more cargo available: Move to colony Beta
4. Orbit colony Beta
5. Unload all cargo
6. IF cargo hold empty: Move to colony Alpha
7. (Repeat from order 1)

**Priority and Override:** When multiple conditions are true simultaneously, the highest-priority (earliest in the queue) matching condition takes effect. Place safety conditions before mission conditions to ensure fleet survival takes priority over mission completion.

**Default Orders:** If no conditions match, the fleet executes the first unconditional order in its queue. If the queue is empty or all orders are conditional with unmet conditions, the fleet holds position.

> **Tip:** Test your conditional order chains with small time increments before fast-forwarding. A logic error in a conditional chain can send your fleet on unexpected paths. Step through a few 5-day increments to verify the group behaves as intended.

> **Tip:** Remember that conditional orders only trigger if the group has the sensors to detect the condition. A group without active sensors cannot trigger "hostile contact detected" conditions based on its own detection -- it would need another group to relay the contact.

## 9.5.6 Fleet Order Templates

Fleet Order Templates allow you to save and reuse complex movement order sequences, eliminating the need to manually reconstruct frequently-used order chains.

**Creating Templates:**
1. Configure a fleet's movement orders exactly as desired
2. Click the "Save Template" button in the Movement Orders tab
3. Enter a descriptive name for the template
4. The complete order sequence is saved for future use

**Applying Templates:**
1. Select "Order Templates" from the Movement Orders tab
2. The system displays all templates that start in the current fleet's system
3. Select the desired template from the dropdown
4. Click "Add Move" to apply all saved orders simultaneously

**Managing Templates:**
- Templates are organized by their starting system -- only templates beginning in your fleet's current system appear in the dropdown
- The "Delete Template" button removes unwanted templates from the system
- Templates can be applied to any fleet in the appropriate starting system

**Practical Applications:**
- Repeated patrol routes that multiple fleets might execute
- Standard supply runs between established colonies
- Defensive patrol patterns for system picket forces
- Survey routes through newly discovered systems
- Convoy escort paths along trade lanes

> **Tip:** Create templates for your standard patrol routes early and name them clearly (e.g., "Sol-Alpha Centauri Patrol Loop"). When you build a new patrol ship, applying the template instantly configures its entire patrol sequence.

## 9.5.7 Auto-Route by System

The Auto-Route by System feature automates the generation of multi-jump movement orders between star systems. Instead of manually plotting each jump point transit, you select a destination system and the game generates all intermediate movement orders automatically.

**How Auto-Route Works:**
1. Enable the Auto-Route by System feature in the Movement Orders tab
2. The normal destination list is replaced with a list of reachable systems
3. Click on a destination system and click "Add Move"
4. The system generates all movement orders (including jump point transits) from the current system to the destination

**Route Control Checkboxes:**

| Checkbox | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Assume Fleet is Jump Capable | Algorithm assumes the fleet can transit any jump point without checking actual jump capability |
| Check Danger Rating | Fleet will not travel through any system where the danger rating exceeds the protection value of friendly warships |
| Exclude Alien-Controlled | Systems flagged as alien-controlled become inaccessible to the route planner |

**Fleet Persistent Settings:** Two settings are saved on the fleet and affect both Auto-Route calculations and Standing/Conditional Orders:
- **Avoid Danger** -- Persists the "Check Danger Rating" preference
- **Avoid Alien Systems** -- Persists the "Exclude Alien-Controlled" preference

**System Blocking:** Individual systems can be flagged on the Galactic Map to exclude them from auto-route calculations entirely, forcing the algorithm to select alternative paths regardless of other settings.

**System List Display:** The destination system list color-codes entries for quick reference:
- **Light green** -- Systems with populated colonies
- **Dark green** -- Systems with other colonies (automated mines, terraformers, tracking stations, etc.)
- Additional display shows total population or the most important installation type

> **Tip:** Use "Check Danger Rating" when routing logistics ships through potentially hostile space. This ensures your freighters automatically avoid systems where they might encounter threats they cannot handle.

> **Tip:** Block systems on the Galactic Map when you want to permanently exclude them from routing, such as systems with known hostile presence or systems you are deliberately avoiding for strategic reasons.

## 9.5.8 Escort Orders

Escort Orders enable one fleet to maintain formation relative to another "Anchor Fleet" while responding to threats. This system allows sophisticated tactical positioning and automated escort management without manual micromanagement.

**Anchor Fleet System:** Each fleet can designate a friendly fleet as its Anchor Fleet and maintain a specified distance and bearing offset. For example:
- Two escort fleets positioned 30 degrees either side and ahead of the main fleet serve as sensor pickets
- Support ships following at 180 degrees (directly behind) stay protected while maintaining close support distance
- Screening destroyers at maximum sensor range ahead provide early warning

**Formation Settings:**
- **Distance** -- How far from the anchor fleet the escort maintains position (in km)
- **Bearing** -- The angular offset from the anchor fleet's heading (in degrees)
- These settings persist even when the fleet joins as a sub-fleet (dormant while integrated, reactivated on detachment)

**Threat Hierarchy:** Escort fleets use a descending priority system to identify and respond to threats:

1. **Specific Alien Ship** -- You designate a particular hostile vessel as the threat reference. This only activates if that specific ship appears on sensors in the same system.
2. **Nearest Hostile Warship** -- If the specific threat is destroyed or leaves sensor range, the fleet automatically targets the nearest hostile warship (defined as an alien vessel known to possess weapons per intelligence data).
3. **Nearest Hostile Contact** -- Without specific or warship threats, the fleet responds to any hostile contact.
4. **Anchor Fleet Destination** -- As a final fallback, the fleet uses the anchor fleet's destination as the threat reference point for positioning.

**Escort Management Controls:**
- **Detach Escorts** -- Releases all sub-fleets that have anchor fleet settings configured, allowing them to take up their pre-configured escort positions independently
- **Recall Escorts** -- Issues "Join As Sub-Fleet" orders to compatible escort fleets in the same system, bringing them back into formation

**Sub-Fleet Integration:** When a fleet joins another as a sub-fleet using "Join as Sub-Fleet," the subordinate fleet retains its formation settings. These settings remain dormant while integrated into the parent fleet but reactivate automatically if the sub-fleet is later detached. This enables a workflow where escort fleets travel as sub-fleets during transit (saving the player from managing multiple fleet movements) and then separate into their tactical escort positions when reaching the operational area.

> **Tip:** Configure your escort fleets with appropriate bearing and distance before integrating them as sub-fleets. When you arrive at the operational area, a single "Detach Escorts" click deploys all escorts to their pre-planned tactical positions.

> **Tip:** For carrier battle groups, position fast escorts at sensor range ahead (bearing 0 degrees) and ASW/point-defense ships close aboard at various bearings. This creates a layered defense that activates automatically on detachment.
