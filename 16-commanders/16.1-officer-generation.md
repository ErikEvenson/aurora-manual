# 16.1 Officer Generation

## 16.1.1 How Officers Are Created

Officers in Aurora C# are the named individuals who command your ships, govern your colonies, lead your research, and manage your military installations. They are generated automatically by the game and possess unique names, skills, and attributes that affect their performance in assigned roles.

### Initial Officers

When you start a new game, your empire begins with a pool of officers already available. These initial officers span various ranks and specializations, providing you with enough personnel to fill critical roles from the start. The initial pool typically includes a mix of naval officers, scientists, and administrators.

### Naval Academies

The primary mechanism for generating new officers is the Naval Academy (also called Officer Training Facility). These are ground installations that produce new officers over time.

**Base Officer Type Distribution:**

Without a commandant influencing the academy, new officers are generated with the following type distribution:

| Type | Probability |
|------|------------|
| Naval Officer | 60% |
| Ground Forces Officer | 25% |
| Administrator | 8% |
| Scientist | 7% |

You can construct additional academies to increase your officer generation rate. Larger empires with many ships and colonies need more academies to avoid officer shortages.

### Academy Commandants

Academy Commandants are commanders assigned to military academies at populated worlds. They influence both the type and quality of officers generated from those academies.

**Commandant Eligibility:**

Different commander types have specific eligibility criteria to serve as commandant:

- **Civilian Administrators**: Admin Rating must equal or exceed the number of military academies at that population.
- **Scientists**: Research Administration rating must be at least five times the number of military academies.
- **Naval/Ground Officers**: Rank must be equal to or greater than the number of military academies (rank 1 = lowest).

**Effect on Officer Type Generation:**

When a commandant is assigned, the type of officer generated shifts toward the commandant's own type:

| Commandant Type | Chance to Generate Same Type |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| Naval Officer | 80% |
| Ground Forces Officer | 40% |
| Scientist | 25% (same research specialization) |
| Administrator | 16% |

**Effect on Officer Quality:**

When a commandant possesses percentage-based bonuses at 20% or higher, or crew/ground training ratings of 150+, newly graduated commanders receive two rolls for each qualifying bonus and use the superior result. This allows specializing academies across different colonies to cultivate tailored officer corps for specific military roles.

### Population-Based Generation

Beyond academies, your population passively generates a small number of officers over time. Larger populations produce more candidates. This represents talented individuals rising through civilian or military channels outside formal academy training.

### Ship Commander Rank Requirements

Commanders must meet minimum rank thresholds based on ship characteristics:

1. **Baseline**: Ships default to the lowest rank requirement if no special conditions apply.
2. **+1 Rank**: Ships equipped with geological sensors, gravitational sensors, auxiliary control, science departments, or jump drives require one rank above baseline.
3. **+2 Ranks**: Ships with weapons, military hangars, main engineering, CIC, or flag bridges require two ranks above baseline.
4. **Exception**: Ships of 1000 tons or less default to the lowest rank requirement unless equipped with control stations.

### Additional Officer Positions

Ships can carry multiple officers in addition to the commander, with tiered rank requirements:

- **Executive Officer, Science Officer, CAG**: One rank below the ship commander requirement.
- **Chief Engineer, Tactical Officer**: Two ranks below the ship commander requirement.

### Officer Names and Name Themes

Aurora C# generates officer names using a robust Name Theme system managed through the Race window. Races can have unlimited Commander Name Themes, a significant expansion from earlier versions.

**Name Theme Configuration:**

- **Initial Setup**: When creating a race, you select a single theme as the default. Unless modified, 100% of generated commanders use this initial theme.
- **Multiple Themes**: Players can assign additional themes, with each receiving a weighted value. When a new commander is generated, the name will be randomly assigned a theme based on the weight of each theme.
- **Visual Indicator**: The Race window displays the primary theme plus the count of additional themes in the top-left section.

**Key Features:**

- **Weighted Distribution**: Each theme has an assigned weight determining selection probability.
- **Automatic Assignment**: The system randomly selects themes when creating new commanders based on these weights.
- **Flexible Customization**: Players can adjust theme weights and add/remove themes at any point during the game.

This system enables more diverse commander naming conventions within a single race, supporting varied cultural or historical naming traditions within your empire.

### The Commander Window

All officer management is handled through the Commanders window, accessible from the main toolbar. This window displays:

- **Available Officers**: Officers not currently assigned to any role.
- **Assigned Officers**: Officers currently filling a position, organized by assignment type.
- **Officer Details**: Selecting an officer shows their full attribute and skill breakdown.
- **Assignment Controls**: Tools for assigning, reassigning, and managing officer positions.

**Tip**: Keep an eye on your officer pipeline. If you are planning a major fleet expansion, start building additional academies well in advance. Ships without commanding officers suffer significant penalties, and you do not want a beautiful new task group sitting idle because you have no one qualified to lead it.

## 16.1.2 Officer Attributes

Every officer in Aurora C# has a set of fundamental attributes that define their capabilities and suitability for various roles.

### Rank

Officers hold military ranks that determine which positions they can fill:

- **Ensign/Lieutenant**: Junior officers suitable for small ship commands or staff positions.
- **Commander/Captain**: Mid-rank officers who can command larger vessels or small task groups.
- **Rear Admiral/Vice Admiral**: Flag officers capable of commanding task groups and fleets.
- **Admiral/Fleet Admiral**: Senior flag officers for the largest fleet commands.

Rank increases through promotion (see Section 16.2.3). Higher-rank positions require officers of appropriate rank -- you cannot assign an Ensign to command a battlefleet.

### Age

Officers have a birth date and age over time. Age affects several aspects of gameplay:

- **Career Duration**: Officers eventually retire or die of old age, removing them from your available pool.
- **Experience**: Older officers have typically accumulated more experience and higher skills (though not always).
- **Health**: Very old officers have an increasing chance of health issues or death each year.

### Traits

Officers may possess special traits that provide unique bonuses or penalties. Traits are randomly assigned at generation and are permanent:

- **Positive Traits**: Examples include "Brilliant Tactician" (combat bonus), "Inspirational Leader" (crew morale bonus), or "Gifted Researcher" (research speed bonus).
- **Negative Traits**: Examples include "Cautious" (slower reaction in combat), "Abrasive" (crew morale penalty), or "Political Appointee" (reduced effectiveness but cannot be easily dismissed).
- **Neutral Traits**: Some traits have situational value, such as "Aggressive" (good for attack commands, poor for defensive positions).

Not all officers have traits -- many are perfectly competent but unremarkable individuals. Traits can make an otherwise average officer exceptional in a specific role or conversely unsuitable for certain positions.

### Loyalty and Morale

Officers have internal loyalty and morale states that can be affected by events:

- **Successful Operations**: Completing missions and winning battles improves officer morale.
- **Defeats and Losses**: Suffering significant casualties or losing ships under their command can reduce morale.
- **Promotion**: Being promoted improves loyalty and morale.
- **Stagnation**: Officers left in the same position for extended periods without promotion may become dissatisfied.

**Tip**: When evaluating officers, do not focus solely on their highest skill. An officer with a moderate skill in the right area and a positive trait can outperform one with a higher base skill but a negative trait. Read the trait descriptions carefully before making assignments.

## 16.1.3 Retirement and Death

Officers are not permanent assets. They age, retire, and eventually die, requiring you to maintain a continuous pipeline of new talent.

### Retirement

Officers retire based on career-specific minimum service times and a probability system.

**Minimum Retirement Times by Career:**

| Career Type | Minimum Retirement Period | Additional Rank Time |
|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Naval Officers | 10 years from lowest rank | +5 years per rank above minimum |
| Ground Forces | 20 years from lowest rank | +5 years per rank above minimum |
| Scientists | 40 years | N/A |
| Administrators | 40 years | N/A |

For example, if Lieutenant Commander is the lowest naval rank, minimum retirement would be 10 years after career start for a Lieutenant Commander, 15 years for a Commander, 20 years for a Captain, and so on.

**Retirement Probability:**

The chance of retirement occurring is 20% for each year beyond the minimum retirement date. This probability is doubled if the commander has no current assignment. Each game increment checks retirement using:

> Retirement Chance = (Increment Length / One Year) x Base Chance (20% or 40% if unassigned)

**Other Retirement Triggers:**

- **Medical Retirement**: Officers who suffer injuries (from combat or accidents) may be forced to retire if the injury is severe enough.

When an officer retires, they are removed from their current assignment and from your available officer pool. Any position they held becomes vacant and must be filled by another qualified officer.

### Death

Officers can die from several causes:

- **Combat**: Officers aboard ships that are destroyed in battle may be killed. The chance of death depends on the severity of the damage and whether the crew managed to evacuate. Ship commanders face the highest risk.
- **Old Age**: Officers beyond a certain age have an annual mortality check. The older they get, the more likely this becomes.
- **Accidents**: Rare random events can kill officers through accidents, illness, or other misfortunes.
- **Ground Combat**: Officers commanding ground forces that are overrun may be killed or captured.

### Impact of Officer Loss

Losing an experienced officer, particularly one in a critical role, can have significant consequences:

- **Command Vacancy**: Ships and fleets without commanders operate at reduced effectiveness until a replacement is assigned.
- **Skill Loss**: A veteran officer with high skills cannot be instantly replaced -- their successor will likely be less experienced.
- **Research Disruption**: If a lead scientist dies, their current research project continues but at a reduced rate until a replacement is assigned.
- **Morale Effects**: The death of a popular or famous officer (such as a fleet admiral who won major battles) can have morale effects on nearby crews.

### Managing Attrition

To avoid officer shortages:

- **Succession Planning**: Identify backup candidates for critical positions before the incumbent retires or is killed.
- **Academy Investment**: Maintain enough academies to replace officers at roughly the rate they are lost.
- **Risk Management**: Consider whether your most skilled officers should be in the most dangerous positions, or whether preserving them in safer roles provides greater long-term value.
- **Promotion Pipeline**: Ensure junior officers are gaining experience and earning promotions so they are ready for senior roles when needed.

**Tip**: Your best fleet admiral is irreplaceable in the short term. If they are commanding your main battle fleet on a dangerous offensive, consider what happens to your strategic situation if they are killed. Sometimes the second-best admiral leading the assault while your best stays in reserve is the wiser choice.
