# 16.2 Skills and Bonuses

## 16.2.1 Skill Categories

Officers in Aurora C# possess skills across multiple categories that determine their effectiveness in various roles. Each skill is rated on a percentage scale, with higher values providing greater bonuses.

### Naval Skills

Naval skills affect ship and fleet command performance:

- **Ship Handling**: Affects the maneuverability and tactical positioning of ships under this officer's command. Higher values improve initiative in combat and make ships harder to hit.
- **Crew Training**: Determines how quickly crews improve their training grade under this officer. Well-trained crews operate their systems more effectively.
- **Fighter Operations**: Affects the coordination and effectiveness of fighter groups. Critical for carriers and fighter wing commanders.
- **Fleet Tactics**: Governs how effectively the officer coordinates multiple ships in a task group. Higher values improve fleet-wide combat performance including coordinated fire and formation integrity.

### Combat Skills

Combat skills directly affect engagement outcomes:

- **Energy Weapons**: Improves accuracy and rate of fire for beam weapons on ships under this officer's command.
- **Kinetic Weapons**: Improves accuracy for railguns and other kinetic weapon systems.
- **Missile Operations**: Affects the accuracy of fire control solutions for missile-armed vessels and improves anti-missile point defense coordination.
- **Electronic Warfare**: Improves ECM effectiveness and reduces the impact of enemy ECM on ships under this commander.

### Administrative Skills

Administrative skills affect non-combat operations:

- **Mining**: Improves the efficiency of mining operations supervised by this officer. Affects both automated mines and manned mining installations.
- **Production**: Increases the output of construction facilities, shipyards, or ordnance factories overseen by this officer.
- **Logistics**: Modifies cargo handling speed. Ships with commanders possessing higher logistics bonuses can load and unload cargo more quickly. Two sources can provide logistics bonuses: the ship commander's personal rating, and an Admin Command bonus if the ship's fleet is within the command radius of a parent Logistics-type Admin Command. Setting up a network of Logistic-focused Admin Commands can boost cargo handling considerably.
- **Population Growth**: When assigned as a colony governor, affects the rate of population growth and immigration on that colony.

### Scientific Skills

Scientific skills determine research effectiveness:

- **Biology/Genetics**: Speeds research in biological and genetic technology fields.
- **Construction/Production**: Speeds research in construction and manufacturing technologies.
- **Defensive Systems**: Speeds research in armor, shields, and defensive technologies.
- **Energy Weapons**: Speeds research in beam weapon and energy technology.
- **Logistics/Ground Combat**: Speeds research in logistics, supply, and ground combat technologies.
- **Missiles/Kinetics**: Speeds research in missile and kinetic weapon technologies.
- **Power/Propulsion**: Speeds research in engine, reactor, and power plant technologies.
- **Sensors/Fire Control**: Speeds research in sensor and fire control technologies.

Each scientist officer will have a primary research specialty (their highest scientific skill) and possibly one or more secondary specialties. Assigning a scientist to research in their specialty field produces the fastest results.

### Diplomatic Skills

Diplomatic skills affect interactions with alien races:

- **Diplomacy**: Improves the rate of communication development with alien races. Officers with high diplomacy skill are ideal for diplomatic missions and communication efforts.
- **Espionage**: Affects intelligence gathering effectiveness. Higher values produce more and better intelligence about alien races and their capabilities.

### Ground Combat Skills

Ground combat skills affect army command:

- **Ground Combat Tactics**: Improves the fighting effectiveness of ground units under this officer's command.
- **Fortification**: Increases the defensive bonus of ground units when dug in.
- **Anti-Insurgency**: Improves effectiveness at suppressing unrest and insurgency on conquered worlds.

**Tip**: When assigning scientists to research projects, always check their specialization. A scientist with 40% in Sensors/Fire Control will often outperform one with 60% in Power/Propulsion when assigned to a sensor research project. The matching between skill and research field is the most important factor.

## 16.2.2 Bonus Generation

When commanders are generated, their bonuses are determined randomly according to probability bands. The following table shows the chance each bonus type is generated for new officers:

| Bonus Type | Generation Chance | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Crew Training | 80% | Concentrated in 5% and 10% bands |
| Ground Combat (Offence/Defence) | 50% | Increases limited to 5% and 10% bands |
| Logistics (Naval) | 50% | All bands increased proportionally |
| Naval Production/Mining/Terraforming | 20% | Concentrated in lower bands |
| Tactical | 20% | All bands increased equally |
| Engineering | 20% | All bands increased equally |
| Political | Variable | Chance of exceeding 10% significantly reduced |

**Design Notes:**

These generation rates support the on-demand promotion system. Political bonuses are deliberately constrained to prevent commanders with excessively high political advantages from dominating promotions. Crew Training bonuses are common because they are universally useful across ship commands.

## 16.2.3 Crew Grade

Crew grade represents a ship's crew training level that develops over time. Higher crew grade provides combat and operational bonuses to the ship.

### Grade Points Accumulation

In C# Aurora, grade points accumulate as follows:

> Grade Points per Year = 50% of Commander's Crew Training Rating + 100% of Executive Officer's Crew Training Rating

**Requirements:**
- Training only occurs if the ship has at least one undamaged command and control system
- Maximum possible grade points: 1000

### Grade Bonus Formula

The crew grade bonus is calculated as:

> Grade Bonus = SQRT(Grade Points) - 10

This produces a maximum possible bonus of approximately 21.6% in C# Aurora.

**Design Philosophy:**

The grade bonus is received more quickly than in VB6 Aurora but has a lower maximum value. The gap is made up by the bonuses of other officers, such as the Tactical Officer or Chief Engineer. This represents a deliberate balance shift -- faster initial benefits but requiring multi-officer contributions for peak performance.

### Crew Morale

Morale represents the crew's readiness and affects ship performance. It is checked only for military ships or vessels with geological survey sensors.

**Default State:** Morale is 100% unless conditions below apply.

**Deployment-Based Morale:**

When the deployment clock exceeds the intended deployment time:

> Morale = Intended Deployment Time / Deployment Clock

For example, a vessel with a 15-month deployment clock against a 12-month intended deployment would have 80% morale.

**Crew Complement Impact:**

If actual crew falls below half the required complement, morale is multiplied by:

> Morale Modifier = (Current Crew / Class Crew) x 2

**Morale Floor:** Morale cannot drop below 25% under normal circumstances.

**Life Support Failure:** When life support systems are destroyed, morale is immediately reduced to 10%.

**Deployment Clock Reduction:**
- Reduces at 10x the normal rate when at recreational locations
- Recreational locations include ships with recreational modules or populations exceeding 50,000
- Parasites in hangars reduce their clocks based on mothership deployment status

## 16.2.4 Bonus Stacking

Multiple skill bonuses can apply simultaneously in many situations. Understanding how these bonuses stack is important for optimizing your officer assignments.

### How Bonuses Are Applied

Most skill bonuses in Aurora C# are applied as percentage modifiers to base effectiveness:

- An officer with 20% in Energy Weapons provides a 20% improvement to beam weapon accuracy for their ship.
- An officer with 35% in Mining provides a 35% improvement to mining output at their colony.
- An officer with 50% in Biology/Genetics provides a 50% improvement to research speed for that field.

### Commander Hierarchy Bonuses

Ships exist within a command hierarchy, and bonuses can come from multiple levels:

1. **Ship Commander**: The captain of an individual vessel provides their personal skill bonuses to that ship.
2. **Task Group Commander**: The senior officer commanding a task group provides fleet-level bonuses that affect all ships in the group.
3. **Fleet Commander**: If task groups are organized into a fleet, the fleet commander provides additional bonuses.

When multiple commanders provide the same type of bonus, the bonuses are typically additive up to a cap. For example:

- Ship captain with 15% Energy Weapons + Task group commander with 25% Fleet Tactics = improved performance from both bonuses.

However, only the most relevant bonus applies in most cases -- a ship captain's Energy Weapons skill directly affects their ship's gunnery, while the task group commander's Fleet Tactics provides a separate fleet-wide coordination bonus.

### Governor Stacking

Colony governors provide their administrative skill bonuses to the colony they manage:

- A governor's Mining skill improves all mining operations on that colony.
- A governor's Production skill improves all construction on that colony.
- A governor's Population Growth skill affects growth rates.

Only one governor can be assigned to a colony at a time. There is no stacking of governor bonuses -- you must choose the governor whose skill profile best matches the colony's primary function.

### Research Stacking

Research benefits from the assigned scientist's relevant skill, but only one scientist can be assigned to each research project. However, you can have multiple research projects running simultaneously with different scientists, each benefiting from their own specialist's bonus.

Research labs themselves stack -- more labs assigned to a project means faster completion. The scientist's bonus then applies as a multiplier to the total lab output.

### Diminishing Returns

Some bonuses may experience diminishing returns at very high values. An officer with 80% in a skill does not necessarily provide twice the benefit of one with 40%. The exact diminishing returns curve varies by skill type, but in general:

- 0-30%: Full linear scaling
- 30-60%: Slightly reduced returns
- 60-100%: Noticeably diminished returns

This means the difference between a 20% officer and a 40% officer is more significant than the difference between a 60% officer and an 80% officer in practical terms.

### Trait Interactions

Officer traits can interact with skill bonuses:

- A positive combat trait stacks with combat skill bonuses, potentially making an already-skilled officer exceptionally effective.
- A negative trait may partially or fully negate a high skill value. An officer with 50% Energy Weapons but the "Cautious" trait may not perform as well as expected in aggressive combat scenarios.

**Tip**: For fleet commands, prioritize Fleet Tactics and Crew Training skills over individual weapon skills. The fleet-wide coordination bonus from a skilled task group commander benefits every ship, while an individual weapon skill only affects the flagship. Save your best gunners for commanding individual capital ships.

## 16.2.5 Promotion and Experience

Officers gain experience over time and can be promoted to higher ranks, unlocking new command opportunities and improving their effectiveness.

### Experience Gain

Officers accumulate experience through active service:

- **Time in Position**: Simply holding an assignment generates experience, though at a slow base rate.
- **Combat**: Officers who participate in combat engagements gain significant experience. The more intense and successful the engagement, the greater the experience reward.
- **Mission Completion**: Successfully completing assigned tasks (survey missions, colony establishment, trade runs) provides experience.
- **Training Exercises**: Officers assigned to training commands or participating in exercises gain moderate experience.

Experience is the primary driver of skill improvement. As officers gain experience, their existing skills gradually improve. The rate of improvement is faster for skills that are actively being used -- a ship commander in frequent combat will see their weapon and tactics skills improve faster than their administrative skills.

### Skill Improvement

Skills improve through experience in several ways:

- **Active Use**: Skills that are directly relevant to the officer's current assignment improve most quickly. A mining colony governor's Mining skill will improve faster than their Fleet Tactics.
- **General Experience**: All skills improve slightly over time regardless of assignment, representing continued professional development.
- **Ceiling**: Skills have a natural ceiling for each officer, determined at generation. Some officers will never exceed 30% in a given skill no matter how much experience they accumulate, while others can reach 80%+.

### Promotion Mechanics

Promotion to higher ranks follows specific rules:

- **Time in Rank**: Officers must serve a minimum time at their current rank before being eligible for promotion. This prevents rapid advancement of inexperienced officers.
- **Experience Threshold**: Officers must accumulate a certain amount of experience before promotion becomes available.
- **Position Requirements**: Some promotions require the officer to have held specific positions or demonstrated competence in their current role.
- **Manual Promotion**: You can promote eligible officers through the Commanders window. Promotion is not automatic -- you must actively promote officers when they become eligible.

### Rank Progression

The standard rank progression for naval officers is:

| Rank | Typical Commands | Minimum Time |
|---|---|---|
| Ensign | Staff positions, shuttles | Starting rank |
| Lieutenant | Small ships, departments | 2-3 years |
| Commander | Frigates, destroyers | 3-5 years |
| Captain | Cruisers, large ships | 5-7 years |
| Commodore | Small task groups | 7-10 years |
| Rear Admiral | Task groups | 10-12 years |
| Vice Admiral | Large task groups | 12-15 years |
| Admiral | Fleets | 15-20 years |
| Fleet Admiral | All forces | 20+ years |

These times are approximate and can be accelerated by exceptional performance (combat experience, successful missions).

### Benefits of Promotion

Promotion provides several benefits:

- **New Commands**: Higher ranks unlock the ability to command larger ships, task groups, and fleets.
- **Morale Boost**: Promoted officers receive a morale and loyalty improvement.
- **Authority**: Higher-ranked officers in the command hierarchy provide their bonuses to more subordinate ships.
- **Prestige**: High-ranking officers with combat experience become named figures whose loss would be significant.

### Promotion Strategy

When deciding who to promote:

- **Match to Need**: Promote officers who will fill roles you actually need filled. If you need a task group commander, promote your best captain.
- **Skill Alignment**: Consider the officer's skill profile. Promoting a captain with high administrative skills to admiral is a waste if you need a combat fleet commander.
- **Career Path**: Officers who have gained experience in progressively larger commands will be more effective at senior levels than those promoted purely on time served.
- **Retention**: Officers passed over for promotion may develop morale issues. Balance strategic optimization against keeping your officer corps satisfied.

**Tip**: Do not promote everyone as soon as they are eligible. You need skilled officers at every rank level. If you promote all your captains to admirals, you will have no one to command individual ships. Maintain a healthy distribution of ranks matching your actual command structure.
