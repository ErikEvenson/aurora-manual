# 16.3 Assignments

## 16.3.1 Ship Commands

The most visible role for officers in Aurora C# is commanding ships and fleets. Every vessel in your navy benefits from having a qualified commanding officer, and the quality of your commanders directly impacts combat effectiveness.

### Ship Commanders

Every ship should have a commanding officer assigned. The ship commander receives half bonuses for Crew Training, Survey, Fighter Operations, Engineering, and Tactical skills. Additional specialist officers assigned to specific modules provide their full bonuses in their respective areas. This creates a "jack-of-all-trades" commander with specialists handling critical functions.

To assign a ship commander, open the Commanders window, select an unassigned officer of appropriate rank, and assign them to an available ship command.

### Command and Control Modules

Seven command and control modules (see [Section 8 Ship Design](../8-ship-design/8.1-design-overview.md)) establish a ship's Control Rating (each module adds +1 to the rating):

| Module | Size | Cost | Function |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| Bridge | 1 HS | 20 BP | Required for all ships; determines minimum commander rank |
| Auxiliary Control | 1 HS | 15 BP | Enables Executive Officer with full Crew Training bonus |
| Science Department | 2 HS | 50 BP | Allows Science Officer applying full Survey bonus |
| Main Engineering | 3 HS | 75 BP | Chief Engineer applies Engineering bonus to maintenance |
| Combat Information Centre | 3 HS | 75 BP | Tactical Officer manages combat functions |
| Primary Flight Control | 4 HS | 100 BP | Commander Air Group applies full Fighter Operations bonus |
| Flag Bridge | 5 HS | 125 BP | Enables fleet commander to improve overall reaction rating |

**Operational Rules:**
- Specialist bonuses apply only if their associated module remains undamaged
- Ships under 1000 tons automatically have a Control Rating of 1
- Officers can be killed if their station sustains damage
- Higher rank requirements take precedence when modules have different minimums

### Ships Without Commanders

A ship without a commanding officer suffers several penalties:

- Reduced crew training rate (training grade will slowly deteriorate).
- No skill bonuses to weapons, sensors, or other systems.
- Reduced morale over time.
- No initiative bonus in combat (slower to react to changing tactical situations).

In an emergency, ships can still operate without commanders, but their effectiveness is significantly reduced. Always prioritize filling combat ship commands before battle.

### No Officers Option

The Class Window includes a "No Officers" toggle that can be applied to individual ship classes. A class with this flag will be ignored for the purposes of auto-assignment. Manual assignment will still be possible.

This feature is useful for ship types that players may not want to staff automatically, such as fighters or other vessel types where officers are not desirable or necessary. It provides granular control over officer management by class rather than requiring per-ship management.

### Auto-Assignment of Naval Commanders

The auto-assignment system matches available commanders to ships needing captains during each construction phase, prioritizing by player-set preferences and ship requirements.

**Assignment Priority Order:**

Ships are processed for assignment in this order:

1. **Commander Priority** (player-set via the ship class window, 0 = Low)
2. **Primary Assignment Priority** (Aurora-determined, based on ship type)
3. **Secondary Assignment Priority** (Aurora-determined, based on descending size)

New ship classes default to priority level 10. The Commander Priority is the most important factor in determining which ships are checked first.

**Ship Classification and Required Bonuses:**

| Priority | Ship Type | Required Bonus |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | Survey ships (geological/gravitational sensors) | Survey |
| 2 | Protected vessels | Crew Training |
| 3 | Military ships | Crew Training |
| 4 | Construction ships | Production |
| 5 | Terraformers | Terraforming |
| 6 | Harvesters | Mining |
| 7 | Asteroid miners | Mining |
| 8 | Salvagers | Production |
| 9 | All others | Logistics |

Secondary priorities rank by descending ship size (or module count where applicable).

**Commander Selection:**

During the initial assignment phase, candidates must possess the ship's required primary bonus or they will not be selected. Unassigned commanders still gain experience and new bonuses gradually.

**Non-Command Position Assignment:**

After ship commanders are assigned, secondary officer positions are filled based on ship modules:

| Position | Required Module | Bonus Used |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Executive Officer | Auxiliary Control | Crew Training |
| Science Officer | Science Department | Survey |
| Commander, Air Group | Primary Flight Control | Fighter Operations |
| Chief Engineer | Main Engineering | Engineering |
| Tactical Officer | CIC | Tactical |

**Supplementary Assignment Passes:**

Three additional passes occur for military ships still lacking commanders after the primary assignment, prioritizing Reaction, then Engineering, then Tactical bonuses respectively.

### Task Group Commanders

When multiple ships operate together in a task group (see [Section 9 Fleet Management](../9-fleet-management/9.1-fleet-organization.md)), a Task Group Commander provides fleet-level coordination. The task group commander is automatically the senior officer among all ship commanders in the group, or can be specifically assigned as a flag officer aboard a designated flagship.

Task group commander bonuses include:

- **Fleet Tactics**: Improves coordination between all ships in the group.
- **Initiative**: The task group acts more decisively in combat.
- **Formation Control**: Ships maintain better formation discipline and spacing.

For maximum effectiveness, assign your best Fleet Tactics officer as the task group commander and ensure they are aboard a suitable flagship (a ship with flag bridge facilities, if you have designed one).

### Fleet Commanders

Fleets (groups of task groups) can have an overall fleet commander who provides the highest level of coordination:

- Fleet-wide tactical bonuses.
- Strategic-level decision making for automated fleet orders.
- Morale bonus to all ships in the fleet.

Fleet commanders require Admiral rank or higher and should be your most experienced and skilled senior officers.

### Carrier and Fighter Commands

Carriers require special attention for officer assignments:

- **Carrier Captain**: Commands the carrier itself, handling ship operations.
- **Fighter Wing Commander**: Commands the embarked fighter groups, affecting their combat performance through Fighter Operations skill.

If your carrier design does not include a separate fighter command position, the ship captain's Fighter Operations skill applies to embarked fighters instead.

**Tip**: When forming a task group for combat, check not just who will command it, but who among the ship captains is the senior officer. If your best frigate captain is senior to your cruiser captains, they will automatically become the task group commander -- potentially commanding the fleet from a frigate while your cruisers go without fleet-level bonuses. Either promote a cruiser captain to higher rank or assign a flag officer to the group specifically.

## 16.3.2 Colony Governors

Every colony benefits from having a governor assigned. Governors provide administrative bonuses that can significantly improve a colony's output and growth.

### Governor Effects

A colony governor applies their administrative skills to the colony:

- **Mining Bonus**: Improves the output of all mining operations (see [Section 6 Economy and Industry](../6-economy-and-industry/6.1-minerals.md)) (both manual mines and automated mines) on the colony. A governor with 30% Mining skill increases mineral extraction by 30%.
- **Production Bonus**: Improves the output of all construction facilities, ordnance factories, and fighter factories on the colony. Critical for major industrial worlds.
- **Population Growth**: Accelerates natural population growth and may improve immigration rates to the colony.
- **Research Bonus**: If the colony has research labs, the governor's relevant research skill can provide a modest bonus to all research conducted there.

### Choosing a Governor

The ideal governor depends on the colony's primary purpose:

- **Industrial Worlds**: Prioritize Production skill. Your main shipbuilding and construction worlds should have your best Production governors.
- **Mining Colonies**: Prioritize Mining skill. Particularly important for resource-rich bodies where increasing output has the greatest absolute effect.
- **Population Centers**: Prioritize Population Growth skill. New colonies that need to grow quickly benefit most from this.
- **Research Centers**: Prioritize the relevant scientific skill if the colony specializes in a particular research area.

### Assigning Governors

To assign a governor:

1. Open the Commanders window.
2. Select an available officer with the desired administrative skills.
3. Assign them to the colony governor position for the target world.

Only one governor can be assigned to each colony. If you reassign a governor, the previous one becomes available in the officer pool.

### Governor Rank Requirements

Governors do not have strict rank requirements like ship commands, but assigning a high-ranking officer as governor of a major colony is appropriate and can provide morale benefits to the population.

### Sector Commanders

For empires with many colonies, sector commanders can provide bonuses to multiple colonies within their sector. This is a higher-level assignment that affects all colonies in a defined region, though with reduced per-colony effectiveness compared to a dedicated governor.

**Tip**: Your Earth (or homeworld equivalent) governor is arguably your most important administrative assignment in the early game. With all your industry concentrated there, even a modest Production bonus translates into significantly faster ship construction and infrastructure development. Assign your best Production officer as homeworld governor immediately.

## 16.3.3 Research and Other Roles

Beyond ships and colonies, officers can fill several specialized roles that are essential to your empire's development.

### Research Scientists

Scientists are officers with high scientific skills who are assigned to lead research projects. This is one of the most impactful officer assignments in the game:

- **Assignment**: Each research project (see [Section 7 Research](../7-research/7.1-technology-tree.md)) requires an assigned scientist. Open the Research window, select a project, and assign a scientist from the available pool.
- **Skill Matching**: The scientist's skill in the relevant research field directly multiplies the research output. A scientist with 50% in Power/Propulsion assigned to an engine research project will produce 50% more research points per year than one with no bonus.
- **Multiple Projects**: Each scientist can only lead one project at a time, but you can have many projects running simultaneously with different scientists.
- **Specialization**: Scientists typically have one or two strong fields. Assigning them to research outside their specialty wastes their potential.

### How to Evaluate Scientists

When reviewing scientists for research assignments, look at:

1. **Primary Skill**: Their highest scientific skill determines their best research field.
2. **Skill Level**: Higher is better, but a 30% specialist is still far better than a 0% generalist.
3. **Secondary Skills**: A scientist with moderate skills in two related fields provides flexibility.
4. **Age**: Young scientists will serve longer before retirement, providing continuity on long research projects.

### Research Prioritization

With limited scientists, prioritize:

- **Critical Technologies**: Assign your best scientists to the technologies you need most urgently.
- **Expensive Research**: High-cost research projects benefit more from scientist bonuses in absolute terms (50% of a large number is more impactful than 50% of a small number).
- **Bottleneck Fields**: If you have many projects in one field but few specialists, that field's scientists become especially valuable.

### Ground Force Commanders

Army units require officers for effective ground combat operations:

- **Battalion/Regiment Commanders**: Lead individual ground units. Their Ground Combat Tactics skill directly affects unit effectiveness.
- **Division/Corps Commanders**: Lead larger formations. Their skills apply to all subordinate units.
- **Garrison Commanders**: Officers assigned to garrison duty focus on fortification and defense. Their Fortification skill provides bonuses to defensive positions.

Ground force commanders use the same assignment interface as other officers -- select the officer and assign them to the relevant ground unit command.

### Intelligence Officers

Officers with high Espionage skill can be assigned to intelligence roles:

- **Intelligence Gathering**: Assigned officers contribute to your intelligence efforts against known alien races.
- **Counter-Intelligence**: Officers can be assigned to protect your own secrets from alien espionage.
- **The intelligence system generates periodic reports about alien capabilities based on your assigned officers' skills and the resources dedicated to the effort.**

### Diplomatic Officers

Officers with high Diplomacy skill serve in diplomatic roles:

- **Communication Teams**: Officers assigned to communication efforts accelerate language learning for specific alien races.
- **Diplomatic Missions**: Officers assigned to diplomatic missions improve the success rate of treaty negotiations and other diplomatic actions.

### Logistical Officers

Officers with Logistics skills can be assigned to logistical commands:

- **Supply Bases**: Improve the efficiency of supply distribution from major logistics centers.
- **Fleet Train**: Officers commanding logistics vessels (see [Section 14 Logistics](../14-logistics/14.1-supply-chains.md)) (tankers, supply ships) with high Logistics skill reduce fuel waste and improve supply delivery rates.

### Unassigned Officers

Officers without assignments remain in the reserve pool. While not actively contributing to operations, they:

- Continue to age and may retire.
- Do not gain experience (or gain it very slowly).
- Remain available for immediate assignment when needed.

Avoid keeping too many officers unassigned for extended periods, as they stagnate and may retire before you use them. Conversely, maintaining a small reserve ensures you can quickly fill vacancies when commanders are killed or retire.

**Tip**: Do not overlook the impact of scientist assignments on your research speed. The difference between having matching specialists and random officers on your research projects can amount to decades of tech development over a long game. Review your scientist assignments whenever new officers become available -- a newly graduated scientist with 45% in your weakest research field is worth immediately reassigning from whatever project they were on.
