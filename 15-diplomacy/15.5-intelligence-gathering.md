# 15.5 Intelligence Gathering

*Added: v2026.01.24*

> **Note:** Espionage teams from VB6 Aurora were removed in C# Aurora. Intelligence gathering in C# is conducted exclusively through ELINT modules on ships and interrogation of survivors. This section documents the C# intelligence system.

## 15.5.1 Intelligence Operations Overview

Intelligence in Aurora C# provides information about alien races, their populations, technologies, and military capabilities without requiring direct diplomatic contact. Unlike the espionage team system from VB6 Aurora, C# relies entirely on Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) gathering and prisoner interrogation.

Intelligence operations are tracked through the Diplomacy window, which shows accumulated intelligence points against each race, information gathered on alien populations, and detected sensor specifications. When racial intelligence points reach 100, an automated espionage check occurs with a chance of yielding actionable intelligence.

### 15.5.1.1 How Intelligence Works

The C# intelligence system uses racial intelligence points that accumulate from two sources:

1. **ELINT Modules**: Ship-based Electronic Intelligence and Analysis Modules passively gather intelligence when in range of alien populations or active sensors.
2. **Prisoner Interrogation**: Survivors rescued from destroyed enemy ships provide intelligence during debriefing.

There are no active espionage missions, sabotage operations, or assassination attempts in C# Aurora. Intelligence gathering is entirely passive and ship-based.

### 15.5.1.2 Intelligence Point Accumulation

Intelligence points come from two primary sources:

| Source | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ELINT Modules | 1 point/day per module in range | Modified by commander Intelligence bonus and target xenophobia |
| Prisoner Interrogation | (Crew/10) + (Rank^3) | Modified by relationship and language |

All sources contribute to the same racial intelligence pool. At 100 accumulated points, an automated check determines what intelligence is gained.

## 15.5.2 ELINT Modules

Electronic Intelligence and Analysis Modules are the primary intelligence-gathering tool in C# Aurora. These ship components passively collect data on alien populations and active sensors.

### 15.5.2.1 ELINT Module Specifications

| Strength | Size (HS) | Cost (BP) | Crew |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strength 5 | 10 | 100 | 15 |
| Strength 6 | 10 | 120 | 15 |
| Strength 8 | 10 | 160 | 15 |
| Strength 11 | 10 | 220 | 15 |
| Strength 14 | 10 | 280 | 15 |

\hyperlink{ref-15.5-1}{[1]}

ELINT modules follow a strength progression similar to EM Sensors. Each module requires the corresponding EM Sensor strength technology as a prerequisite. The cost formula is 20 x Strength. \hyperlink{ref-15.5-1}{[1]}

### 15.5.2.2 Secondary Sensor Function

ELINT modules have a secondary function as EM Sensors, though a dedicated EM sensor of the same size would be far more effective. Their primary value is intelligence gathering rather than detection.

### 15.5.2.3 Intelligence Gathering Rate

The base rate is 1 intelligence point per day per ELINT module within detection range of the target. This rate is modified by:

- **Commander Intelligence Bonus**: Multiplies the base gathering rate.
- **Target Xenophobia**: Rate is multiplied by (100 - Target Xenophobia) / 100. Higher xenophobia populations are harder to gather intelligence from.
- **Language Penalty**: All intelligence gains are reduced by 80% if the alien language has not been translated.

> **Tip:** Multiple ELINT ships cannot increase intelligence gathered from a single source -- only one module's rate applies. However, a single ELINT module can simultaneously gather intelligence from multiple targets within range.

### 15.5.2.4 Detection Requirements

ELINT modules can only gather intelligence from targets they can detect via their built-in EM Sensors. This means:

- **Populations**: Must be within EM detection range based on the population's EM signature.
- **Active Sensors**: Must be actively emitting to be detected and analysed.

### 15.5.2.5 Intelligence Decay

When ELINT monitoring ceases (module leaves detection range), accumulated population intelligence points decay at approximately 25% per year. However, the maximum information gained is preserved:

- **Red Text**: Historical maximum intelligence (preserved).
- **Green Text**: Current intelligence level (decaying).

## 15.5.3 Population Intelligence Thresholds

As ELINT modules accumulate intelligence points on a specific population, progressively more detailed information becomes available:

| Intelligence Points | Information Revealed |
|---|---|
| 100 | Population size and total installation count |
| 200 | Factory, mine, and spaceport data |
| 300 | Refinery and maintenance facility information |
| 500 | Research and training facility data |

This information is displayed in the Diplomacy window when viewing the alien population.

## 15.5.4 Active Sensor Intelligence

ELINT modules also gather data on active sensors they detect. The mechanics differ from population intelligence:

- **Rate**: 1 intelligence point per day per detected sensor.
- **Initial Data**: Only sensor strength is displayed when first detected.
- **Full Specification**: After accumulating 100 points on a specific sensor, its range and resolution become visible.

This provides crucial tactical information about enemy detection capabilities without requiring direct combat.

## 15.5.5 Prisoner Interrogation

Survivors rescued from destroyed enemy ships provide an alternative source of intelligence points. This represents debriefing and intelligence extraction from captured personnel.

### 15.5.5.1 Intelligence Point Formula

```
Intelligence Points = (Crew / 10) + (Rank^3)
```

For example, capturing an R3 (rank 3) officer contributes 27 points (3 cubed = 27) in addition to any crew-based points. Higher-ranking officers provide exponentially more intelligence.

### 15.5.5.2 Relationship Modifiers

Intelligence gains from interrogation are reduced based on your diplomatic relationship with the captured personnel's race:

| Relationship | Modifier |
|---|---|
| Hostile | Full intelligence gain (no reduction) |
| Neutral | 50% reduction |
| Friendly | 80% reduction |
| Allied | 90% reduction |

These reductions simulate that aggressive interrogation is unlikely against survivors from amicable factions.

### 15.5.5.3 Language Requirements

A further 80% reduction applies if the alien language has not been translated. This stacks with the relationship modifier:

- Untranslated hostile survivors yield only 20% of base intelligence.
- Untranslated allied survivors yield only 2% of base intelligence.

## 15.5.6 Racial Intelligence Conversion

Intelligence gathered on individual populations converts to racial intelligence points:

- **1:1 Conversion**: Each Population Intelligence Point adds one Racial Intelligence Point.
- **Small Population Modifier**: Populations under 100 million contribute proportionally less: (Population in millions / 100).

Racial intelligence points accumulate across all sources (ELINT and interrogation) for each alien race.

## 15.5.7 Intelligence Check Results

When accumulated racial intelligence points reach 100, an automated espionage check occurs. The system randomly determines what intelligence is gained from the following categories:

| Result Category | Description |
|---|---|
| Technology Theft | A specific technology known to the target but not to you |
| Missile Blueprints | Complete design specifications for a target missile type |
| Gravitational Survey Data | Jump point locations in systems the target has surveyed |
| Geological Survey Data | Mineral deposit data from the target's surveyed systems |
| New System Locations | Awareness of star systems the target has explored |
| Ship Class Summaries | Design details of specific enemy ship classes |
| Sensor Information | Specifications of enemy sensor systems |

### 15.5.7.1 Captured Ship Intelligence

*Added: v2.6.0*

The Intelligence window provides enhanced information for captured enemy vessels:

- **Class Summary Display**: Captured ships now display a class summary in the Intelligence window, providing detailed information about the vessel's design specifications, component loadout, and capabilities.
- **Analysis Benefits**: This feature allows players to analyze captured technology without requiring separate ship design review, streamlining the process of evaluating enemy capabilities.

### 15.5.7.2 Destruction Location Tracking

*Added: v2.6.0*

The Intelligence window records the system of destruction for destroyed alien ships:

- **Location Recording**: When an alien ship is destroyed, the Intelligence window notes which system the destruction occurred in.
- **Combat History**: This information helps track combat engagement locations and enemy losses across different systems.
- **Strategic Analysis**: Players can use destruction location data to analyze patterns in enemy fleet movements and identify successful defensive positions.

### 15.5.7.3 Intelligence Quality

The quality and specificity of intelligence results improves with:

- Higher accumulated intelligence points beyond the threshold.
- Better Intelligence skill on ELINT ship commanders.
- Higher communication level with the target race (translated languages yield better intelligence).
- Longer sustained intelligence operations.

> **Tip:** Intelligence checks happen automatically at 100-point intervals. You do not need to manually trigger them. Focus on maximising your intelligence point accumulation rate through ELINT coverage, and the checks will occur regularly as points accrue.

## 15.5.8 Diplomatic Implications

Unlike the VB6 espionage system, ELINT intelligence gathering has no diplomatic consequences. Passive sensor observation is not considered an act of espionage by the game mechanics.

### 15.5.8.1 ELINT Advantages

- **No Detection Risk**: NPRs cannot detect ELINT operations against them.
- **No Diplomatic Penalty**: Gathering intelligence via ELINT does not affect diplomatic relations.
- **Continuous Operation**: ELINT ships can operate indefinitely without risk of discovery.

### 15.5.8.2 Limitations

- **Passive Only**: You cannot conduct active operations (sabotage, assassination) in C# Aurora.
- **Range Dependent**: ELINT modules must be within detection range of targets.
- **Time Investment**: Accumulating sufficient intelligence points requires sustained presence.

## 15.5.9 Commander Skill Integration

The Intelligence bonus (available to naval officers only) affects ELINT operations:

- **Intelligence Gathering Rate**: The commander's Intelligence bonus multiplies the base 1 point/day rate.
- **Naval Officers Only**: Ground force commanders cannot gain Intelligence bonuses in C# Aurora. \hyperlink{ref-15.5-2}{[2]}

When designing dedicated ELINT ships, consider assigning commanders with high Intelligence skill to maximise intelligence gathering efficiency.
