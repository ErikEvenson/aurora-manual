# 15.1 Alien Races

## 15.1.1 NPR Generation

Non-Player Races (NPRs) are the AI-controlled alien civilizations that populate the galaxy. Aurora C# generates these races through several mechanisms, each producing different types of encounters.

### Spoiler Race Generation

When starting a new game, you can configure the galaxy to include NPRs from the start. The game settings allow you to specify:

- **Number of NPRs**: How many alien races exist at game start.
- **Tech Level Range**: NPRs can range from pre-industrial civilizations to advanced spacefaring empires. The tech level is randomized within the range you specify.
- **Distance from Sol**: You can set minimum and maximum distances (in jump points) from your starting system to NPR homeworlds, controlling how quickly you are likely to encounter them.

Each generated NPR receives a randomly determined species with unique characteristics including atmospheric requirements, gravity tolerance, and temperature preferences. These biological parameters determine which worlds the NPR will colonize and terraform, creating natural competition for habitable real estate.

### Random Generation During Play

Beyond the initial setup, Aurora C# can generate new NPRs during gameplay. When your survey ships explore new systems, there is a chance of discovering previously unknown civilizations. The probability and tech level of these encounters depends on your game settings. A system with habitable worlds is more likely to contain a civilization.

### NPR Characteristics

Each NPR is generated with a complete set of attributes:

- **Government Type**: Determines diplomatic tendencies and internal policies.
- **Aggression Level**: Ranges from pacifist to extremely aggressive, influencing how the NPR reacts to contact and territorial encroachment.
- **Expansion Drive**: Controls how actively the NPR colonizes new worlds and builds fleets.
- **Technology Focus**: NPRs may emphasize different tech paths -- some focus on beam weapons while others develop missiles, and their ship designs reflect these preferences.
- **Fleet Doctrine**: Determines ship sizes, fleet compositions, and tactical behavior in combat.
- **Diplomatic Disposition**: Affects willingness to negotiate, trade, and form alliances.

These characteristics are persistent throughout the game, though an NPR's behavior will also respond dynamically to its strategic situation (being at war, losing territory, or encountering a much stronger power).

### Viewing NPR Information

You can view known NPR information through the Race Intelligence window (accessible from the main toolbar). This window shows all races you have detected, along with whatever information your intelligence efforts have gathered. Initially, you will know very little about a newly discovered race -- further contact and intelligence operations reveal more details over time.

**Tip**: Pay close attention to the atmospheric requirements of alien races. If they breathe the same atmosphere as your species, you are competing for the same worlds. Races with incompatible atmospheres may be easier to coexist with, as you will not be fighting over the same planets.

## 15.1.2 NPR Behavior

NPR civilizations are not static -- they actively pursue their own goals, build ships, research technology, and expand their territory. Understanding NPR behavior patterns helps you anticipate threats and opportunities.

### Economic Activity

NPRs manage their own economies, including:

- **Mining Operations**: NPRs exploit mineral deposits on their worlds and may establish mining colonies on resource-rich bodies.
- **Construction**: They build installations, shipyards, and orbital facilities.
- **Research**: NPRs advance through the tech tree, though their rate of progress depends on their population, research facilities, and tech focus.
- **Population Growth**: NPR populations grow over time, providing more labor and enabling further expansion.

### Military Behavior

NPR military behavior is driven by their aggression level, fleet doctrine, and strategic circumstances:

- **Fleet Building**: NPRs continuously design and construct warships. Their designs evolve over time as they research new technologies.
- **Patrols**: NPRs typically maintain patrol fleets in their home systems and along their borders.
- **Expansion**: Based on their expansion drive, NPRs will send colony ships to suitable worlds within their reach.
- **Response to Threats**: When NPRs detect your ships in their territory, their response depends on their aggression level and your diplomatic relationship. Aggressive races may attack on sight, while peaceful ones may simply monitor your presence.

### Decision Making

NPR decision-making follows a priority system:

1. **Defend Homeworld**: The NPR will always prioritize defense of its capital.
2. **Protect Colonies**: Established colonies receive defensive attention proportional to their value.
3. **Expand Territory**: NPRs seek to colonize new worlds and control jump points.
4. **Pursue Diplomacy**: Based on disposition, NPRs may seek treaties or issue demands.
5. **Project Power**: Aggressive NPRs may launch offensive operations against perceived rivals.

**Tip**: If you notice an NPR massing ships near a jump point connecting to your territory, take it seriously. NPRs do not bluff -- fleet movements indicate intent.

### NPR Awareness

NPRs have their own sensor networks and intelligence capabilities:

- They detect your ships using their own active and passive sensors.
- They track ship movements through their territory.
- They assess your military strength based on what they have observed.
- Their diplomatic and military decisions factor in their perception of your power relative to their own.

## 15.1.3 First Contact

The moment of first contact with an alien race is one of the most significant events in an Aurora campaign. How it unfolds depends on the circumstances of discovery and both parties' characteristics.

### Detection Methods

First contact can occur through several channels:

- **Survey Ships**: Your geological or gravitational survey vessels enter a system containing an NPR civilization. This is the most common method of discovery.
- **Sensor Detection**: Your passive or active sensors pick up emissions from alien ships or installations.
- **Jump Point Encounter**: An NPR exploration vessel transits a jump point into one of your systems, or vice versa.
- **Shared System Discovery**: Both civilizations expand into the same unclaimed system simultaneously.

### The First Contact Process

When first contact occurs, several things happen:

1. **Detection Event**: A message alerts you that an alien race has been detected. The message includes the location and method of detection.
2. **Race Created**: If this is a genuinely new race (not a previously known one encountered in a new location), the race is added to your intelligence database.
3. **Initial Relationship**: The starting diplomatic relationship is set based on the NPR's disposition and the circumstances of contact. Peaceful discovery typically starts at neutral, while contact through combat starts hostile.
4. **Communication Barrier**: You cannot meaningfully communicate with the alien race until you develop sufficient understanding of their language (see Section 15.2).

### Factors Affecting First Contact Outcome

Several factors influence how first contact plays out:

- **Location**: Discovering an NPR in unclaimed space is less provocative than being found deep in their territory.
- **Military Presence**: If your first contact involves a large warfleet, aggressive NPRs may feel threatened. Unarmed survey ships are less likely to provoke hostility.
- **NPR Aggression**: Highly aggressive races may attack on first contact regardless of circumstances.
- **NPR Tech Level**: A primitive race that detects your advanced ships may react with fear or awe, while a technologically superior race may view you as insignificant.

### Preparing for First Contact

Smart players prepare for the possibility of first contact:

- **Arm Survey Ships**: Even a token defensive armament can allow a survey ship to survive long enough to flee.
- **Escort Fleets**: Consider stationing warships at jump points along your exploration frontier.
- **Communication Ships**: Designate ships with communication equipment to quickly establish dialogue with discovered races.
- **Standing Orders**: Decide in advance whether your exploration ships should flee, hold position, or attempt communication when encountering unknowns.

**Tip**: The galaxy in Aurora can be a dangerous place. Never send survey ships into unexplored space without at least considering what happens if they find something hostile. A destroyed survey ship not only costs you the vessel and crew, but also tells the alien race exactly where to find you.
