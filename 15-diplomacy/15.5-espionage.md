# 15.5 Espionage

*Added: v2026.01.24*

## 15.5.1 Intelligence Operations Overview

Espionage in Aurora C# provides a covert alternative to direct military confrontation. Through intelligence operations, you can steal technology, sabotage enemy installations, gather surveillance data, or eliminate key personnel -- all without formally declaring war. However, these operations carry significant risk: getting caught can destroy diplomatic relationships and trigger conflicts you may not be prepared to fight.

Intelligence operations are managed through the Intelligence window, accessible from the main toolbar. This window shows your active intelligence teams, their assignments, accumulated intelligence points against each race, and the results of past operations.

### How Intelligence Works

The espionage system builds on the racial intelligence points described in [Section 15.1 Alien Races](15.1-alien-races.md). Intelligence points accumulate through ELINT operations, interrogation of prisoners, and active espionage missions. When racial intelligence points reach 100, an automated espionage check occurs with a chance of yielding actionable intelligence.

Active espionage missions are distinct from passive ELINT gathering. While ELINT modules on ships passively accumulate intelligence by monitoring alien populations and sensors, active espionage requires deploying intelligence teams to enemy worlds where they conduct targeted operations at greater risk but with potentially greater reward.

### Intelligence Point Accumulation

Intelligence points come from three primary sources:

| Source | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ELINT Modules | 1 point/day per module in range | Modified by commander bonus and target xenophobia |
| Prisoner Interrogation | (Crew/10) + (Rank^3) | Modified by relationship and language |
| Active Espionage Teams | Variable | Based on team skill and mission type |

All sources contribute to the same racial intelligence pool. At 100 accumulated points, an automated check determines what intelligence is gained.

## 15.5.2 Types of Espionage Missions

Intelligence teams can be assigned to several categories of mission, each with different objectives, difficulty levels, and consequences if detected.

### Technology Theft

The most common espionage objective is stealing technological secrets from an alien race. Success grants your empire a specific technology that the target has already researched.

- **Difficulty**: Moderate to high, depending on the technology level difference between the two races.
- **Requirements**: Racial intelligence points must reach the automated check threshold (100 points).
- **Outcome on Success**: A random technology known to the target race (but not to you) is added to your research database. The stolen technology may be from any research field the alien race has explored.
- **Detection Risk**: Low for passive checks; higher for active team operations.

Technologies that can be stolen through espionage checks include:

- Ship component technologies (engines, sensors, weapons)
- Armor and defensive technologies
- Missile and fire control systems
- Industrial and economic technologies

> **Tip:** Technology theft becomes exponentially more valuable against races significantly more advanced than yours. A single stolen propulsion technology from a superior race can save decades of research time. Prioritise intelligence gathering against technologically advanced neighbours.

### Sabotage

Sabotage missions target enemy installations, shipyards, or ground infrastructure, destroying or damaging them without a formal military attack.

- **Difficulty**: High. Sabotage requires the intelligence team to physically access and damage the target.
- **Requirements**: An active intelligence team on the target world.
- **Outcome on Success**: Destruction or damage to specific installations (factories, mines, shipyards, research labs).
- **Detection Risk**: Very high. Sabotage is difficult to conceal, and the target race will almost certainly investigate.
- **Diplomatic Consequence**: Severe. Detected sabotage generates large negative diplomatic points and can trigger immediate hostility.

### Surveillance

Surveillance missions focus on gathering detailed information about an enemy's military capabilities, economic output, and strategic intentions.

- **Difficulty**: Low to moderate. Observation is less risky than active interference.
- **Requirements**: An active intelligence team on or near the target world.
- **Outcome on Success**: Detailed information about the target's fleet compositions, ship designs, population sizes, installation counts, and military deployments.
- **Detection Risk**: Moderate. Sustained surveillance increases the chance of detection over time.
- **Diplomatic Consequence**: Moderate. Detected espionage is unwelcome but less provocative than sabotage or assassination.

Surveillance yields intelligence equivalent to ELINT operations but can sometimes provide higher-quality data about specific targets, including:

- Ship class details and armament
- Fleet deployment locations
- Mineral stockpiles and production capacity
- Research progress in specific fields

### Assassination

The most extreme espionage operation targets specific enemy commanders or leaders for elimination.

- **Difficulty**: Very high. Assassination of senior officers is extremely dangerous.
- **Requirements**: An active intelligence team on the target world with high espionage skill.
- **Outcome on Success**: Death of a targeted enemy commander. The target loses their skills, bonuses, and any command they hold.
- **Detection Risk**: Very high. Even successful assassinations are usually traced back to the perpetrator.
- **Diplomatic Consequence**: Catastrophic. Detected assassination attempts generate the largest possible negative diplomatic impact, effectively guaranteeing war.

> **Warning:** Assassination missions should be reserved for situations where war is already inevitable or ongoing. The diplomatic fallout from a detected assassination attempt is so severe that it will destroy any remaining goodwill with the target race -- and potentially with other races who learn of your actions.

## 15.5.3 Intelligence Agents

Intelligence operations require trained personnel. In Aurora C#, intelligence agents are ground force officers assigned to espionage duties.

### Officer Requirements

Intelligence agents are drawn from your officer corps with the following characteristics:

- **Branch**: Ground force officers are eligible for intelligence assignment (see [Section 16.1 Officer Generation](../16-commanders/16.1-officer-generation.md)).
- **Espionage Skill**: The officer's Espionage bonus (see [Section 16.2 Skills and Bonuses](../16-commanders/16.2-skills-and-bonuses.md)) determines their effectiveness in intelligence operations. Higher values improve success chances and reduce detection risk.
- **Assignment**: Officers must be specifically assigned to intelligence duties through the Commanders window.

> **Note:** As of v2.4.0, ground force commanders cannot gain Diplomacy or Intelligence bonuses -- these are exclusive to naval officers. This restriction means espionage-capable officers must come from the naval branch rather than ground forces. Check the current version's skill restrictions when assigning intelligence personnel.

### Intelligence Team Composition

An intelligence team consists of:

- **Team Leader**: A commander with Espionage skill. The leader's skill level is the primary determinant of mission success.
- **Support Personnel**: Additional officers or personnel who assist the leader. Larger teams can accomplish more complex missions but are harder to conceal.

### Assigning Intelligence Teams

To assign an officer to intelligence duties:

1. Open the Commanders window.
2. Select an unassigned officer with Espionage skill.
3. Assign them to an intelligence team targeting a specific race.
4. Select the mission type (surveillance, technology theft, sabotage, assassination).
5. The team becomes active and begins operating during subsequent time increments.

## 15.5.4 Espionage Skill and Success Chances

The probability of a successful espionage operation depends on several factors, with the team leader's Espionage skill being the most significant.

### Success Probability Factors

| Factor | Effect |
|---|---|
| Espionage Skill (leader) | Primary determinant. Higher skill = higher success chance |
| Target Xenophobia | Higher xenophobia = better counter-intelligence = lower success |
| Mission Type | Surveillance easiest, assassination hardest |
| Intelligence Points | More accumulated intelligence = better success chance |
| Target Population Size | Larger populations are easier to infiltrate |
| Language Comprehension | Higher communication level with target = improved success |

### Skill-Based Modifiers

The team leader's Espionage bonus directly scales the base success probability:

- **0-10% Espionage**: Minimal chance of success on any mission. Likely to be detected.
- **10-25% Espionage**: Viable for surveillance missions. Technology theft is possible but risky.
- **25-50% Espionage**: Competent intelligence work. Reasonable success rates for most mission types.
- **50-75% Espionage**: Expert level. High success rates even on difficult missions.
- **75%+ Espionage**: Elite capability. Even assassination missions have meaningful success chances.

### Experience and Improvement

Intelligence officers gain experience through active operations:

- Successful missions improve Espionage skill at an accelerated rate.
- Failed missions (where the team survives) still provide some experience.
- Long-term surveillance assignments provide steady but slow experience gain.
- Officers with natural aptitude (high initial Espionage skill) improve more quickly.

> **Tip:** Your first intelligence officers will likely have low Espionage skills. Start them on surveillance missions against less-defended targets to build their experience before attempting high-risk operations like sabotage or assassination.

## 15.5.5 Counter-Intelligence and Detection

Just as you can spy on other races, they can spy on you. Counter-intelligence measures protect your empire from enemy espionage operations.

### Detection Mechanics

When an enemy intelligence team operates on one of your worlds, detection is checked each time increment based on:

- **Your Counter-Intelligence Rating**: Derived from ground force units with counter-intelligence capability stationed on the world.
- **Enemy Team Skill**: Higher-skilled enemy agents are harder to detect.
- **Mission Activity Level**: Active operations (sabotage, assassination) are easier to detect than passive surveillance.
- **Population Size**: Larger populations provide more cover for foreign agents, making detection harder.

### Counter-Intelligence Measures

Several factors improve your ability to detect and neutralize foreign intelligence operations:

- **Ground Force Presence**: Military units stationed on a world contribute to counter-intelligence capability. More units mean better coverage.
- **Intelligence Officers**: Assigning officers with Espionage skill to counter-intelligence duties on your own worlds improves detection rates.
- **Population Size**: While larger populations provide cover for enemy agents, they also provide more eyes and ears for your security services. The net effect is complex.
- **Xenophobia**: Races with higher xenophobia are naturally more suspicious of outsiders, providing a passive counter-intelligence bonus.

### Detection Events

When a foreign intelligence team is detected:

1. **Alert**: An event notification informs you that enemy agents have been detected on one of your worlds.
2. **Identification**: If your counter-intelligence is strong enough, you may identify the race operating the team.
3. **Neutralisation**: Detected teams may be captured or forced to withdraw, ending their operations.
4. **Diplomatic Action**: You can choose to protest the espionage through diplomatic channels, potentially generating negative diplomatic points against the offending race.

### Preventing Enemy Espionage

Proactive measures to limit enemy intelligence operations:

- Station ground forces on important worlds, particularly those with significant industry or research.
- Assign counter-intelligence officers to high-value colonies.
- Monitor the Intelligence window for unexplained intelligence accumulation by other races against you.
- Maintain active sensor coverage around key worlds to detect intelligence-gathering ships.

> **Warning:** Do not neglect counter-intelligence on your homeworld and major industrial centres. A successful enemy sabotage operation against your primary shipyard can set your military production back by years. The cost of stationing security forces is trivial compared to the potential damage.

## 15.5.6 Wealth Costs of Operations

Intelligence operations consume wealth from your treasury. The costs vary by mission type and duration, representing the funding required for covert activities, equipment, bribes, and support infrastructure.

### Mission Cost Structure

| Mission Type | Wealth Cost | Payment Schedule |
|---|---|---|
| Surveillance | Low | Ongoing per time increment |
| Technology Theft (passive) | None (via ELINT) | N/A |
| Technology Theft (active) | Moderate | Per operation attempt |
| Sabotage | High | Per operation attempt |
| Assassination | Very High | Per operation attempt |

### Cost Factors

The actual wealth cost of each operation is influenced by:

- **Distance to Target**: Operations against distant races cost more due to logistics.
- **Team Size**: Larger teams require more funding.
- **Mission Duration**: Long-term surveillance accumulates ongoing costs.
- **Target Security Level**: Operating against well-defended targets requires more expensive countermeasures and equipment.

### Budgeting for Intelligence

Intelligence costs appear in the wealth expenditure breakdown of the Economics window (see [Section 6.4 Wealth and Trade](../6-economy-and-industry/6.4-wealth-and-trade.md)). When planning your intelligence budget:

- Surveillance is affordable enough to maintain against multiple targets simultaneously.
- Active operations (sabotage, assassination) should be budgeted carefully as one-time expenses.
- A large intelligence apparatus (many teams against many targets) can become a significant wealth drain.
- Balance intelligence spending against military maintenance and economic development.

> **Tip:** Passive ELINT intelligence gathering from ships is free beyond the initial ship construction cost. If you want intelligence without the wealth drain of active teams, maintain ELINT-equipped ships in range of alien populations. Active espionage teams are best reserved for specific high-value objectives.

## 15.5.7 Foreign Intelligence Teams on Your Worlds

Other races conduct espionage against you using the same mechanics available to you. Awareness and preparation are essential.

### Signs of Enemy Espionage

Indicators that foreign agents may be operating on your worlds:

- **Unexplained Events**: Mysterious installation damage or commander deaths that do not correlate with combat.
- **Intelligence Leaks**: The enemy seems to know about your fleet movements or military preparations before you announce them.
- **Counter-Intelligence Alerts**: Your security forces detect unusual activity or identify foreign operatives.
- **Diplomatic Anomalies**: An NPR's knowledge of your capabilities seems disproportionate to their sensor coverage.

### Responding to Enemy Espionage

When you confirm foreign intelligence operations on your worlds:

1. **Increase Security**: Station additional ground forces and assign counter-intelligence officers.
2. **Diplomatic Protest**: Use the Diplomacy window to register a formal protest, generating negative diplomatic points for the offending race.
3. **Expel Operatives**: If identified, enemy teams can be forcibly removed.
4. **Retaliation**: Consider launching your own espionage operations against the offending race.
5. **Military Response**: In extreme cases (repeated sabotage, assassination attempts), military action may be warranted.

### NPR Intelligence Behaviour

NPR races conduct intelligence operations according to their characteristics:

- **High Xenophobia NPRs**: Less likely to use espionage (prefer direct confrontation) but better at counter-intelligence.
- **High Diplomacy NPRs**: More likely to use surveillance and technology theft as alternatives to war.
- **High Militancy NPRs**: May use sabotage as a precursor to military operations.
- **All NPRs**: Will respond aggressively to detected espionage against them, with diplomatic penalties scaled to their Xenophobia and Militancy.

## 15.5.8 Diplomatic Consequences of Getting Caught

The greatest risk of espionage is not mission failure -- it is detection. Getting caught conducting intelligence operations against another race has severe and lasting diplomatic consequences.

### Immediate Consequences

When your espionage team is detected:

| Detection Type | Diplomatic Point Penalty | Relationship Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Surveillance detected | -25 to -50 | May drop to Unfriendly |
| Technology theft detected | -50 to -100 | Likely drops to Hostile |
| Sabotage detected | -100 to -200 | Almost certainly Hostile |
| Assassination detected | -200 to -300 | Guaranteed Hostile; war likely |

These penalties are modified by the target race's Xenophobia -- more xenophobic races react more harshly to detected espionage.

### Long-Term Consequences

Beyond the immediate diplomatic penalty:

- **Trust Degradation**: The offended race becomes permanently more suspicious. Future diplomatic efforts are less effective.
- **Counter-Intelligence Increase**: The target race increases security on all their worlds, making future operations harder.
- **Third-Party Awareness**: Other races that have intelligence contact with the offended party may learn of your espionage, damaging your broader reputation.
- **Treaty Cancellation**: Detected espionage against a treaty partner may trigger automatic cancellation of all existing treaties.
- **Military Escalation**: Hostile races may use detected espionage as justification for military action.

### Risk Mitigation

To minimise the consequences of detection:

- **Deniability**: Some mission configurations provide plausible deniability. Passive intelligence gathering through ELINT is inherently deniable since sensor observation is not itself an act of espionage.
- **Diplomatic Buffer**: Maintain high diplomatic points with the target before attempting espionage. A strong existing relationship can absorb the penalty of detection without reaching Hostile status.
- **Expendable Teams**: Be prepared to disavow detected teams. The diplomatic penalty occurs regardless, but acknowledging and withdrawing may prevent escalation.
- **Target Selection**: Conduct espionage primarily against races you expect to conflict with eventually. Spying on close allies is both unnecessary and catastrophically damaging if detected.

> **Warning:** Never conduct espionage operations against a race you are Allied with. The detection penalty combined with treaty violation consequences can instantly destroy a decades-old alliance. Reserve espionage for races at Neutral or worse standing -- or those you are prepared to fight.

## 15.5.9 Intelligence Check Results

When accumulated racial intelligence points trigger an automated check (at 100-point thresholds), the system randomly determines what intelligence is gained from the following categories:

### Possible Intelligence Results

| Result Category | Description |
|---|---|
| Technology Theft | A specific technology known to the target but not to you |
| Missile Blueprints | Complete design specifications for a target missile type |
| Gravitational Survey Data | Jump point locations in systems the target has surveyed |
| Geological Survey Data | Mineral deposit data from the target's surveyed systems |
| New System Locations | Awareness of star systems the target has explored |
| Ship Class Summaries | Design details of specific enemy ship classes |
| Sensor Information | Specifications of enemy sensor systems |

### Intelligence Quality

The quality and specificity of intelligence results improves with:

- Higher accumulated intelligence points beyond the threshold
- Better Espionage skill on assigned officers
- Higher communication level with the target race (translated languages yield better intelligence)
- Longer sustained intelligence operations

> **Tip:** Intelligence checks happen automatically at 100-point intervals. You do not need to manually trigger them. Focus on maximising your intelligence point accumulation rate through ELINT coverage and active teams, and the checks will occur regularly as points accrue.
