# 15.2 Communications

## 15.2.1 Language Barriers

In Aurora C#, you cannot simply open a dialogue with an alien race the moment you discover them. A realistic language barrier exists that must be overcome through dedicated effort before meaningful diplomacy can begin.

### Communication Rating

Your ability to communicate with each alien race is tracked as a percentage from 0% to 100%. This rating represents how well you understand their language and can make yourself understood:

- **0%**: No communication possible. You can observe the aliens but cannot exchange any meaningful information.
- **1-19%**: Extremely basic communication. Simple concepts like "stop" or "go away" might be conveyed, but misunderstandings are frequent.
- **20-39%**: Basic communication. You can express simple intentions and understand broad responses, but nuance is lost.
- **40-59%**: Functional communication. Diplomatic proposals can be made and understood, though complex negotiations remain difficult.
- **60-79%**: Good communication. Most diplomatic options are available, and misunderstandings become rare.
- **80-99%**: Excellent communication. Full diplomatic functionality with only occasional ambiguity.
- **100%**: Perfect communication. Complete mutual understanding with no language barriers.

The communication rating directly affects which diplomatic options are available and the likelihood of diplomatic messages being correctly interpreted.

### Building Communication

Communication ratings improve through several mechanisms:

- **Xenology Labs**: The primary method. Xenology labs (a type of research facility) are ground installations that work to decode alien languages. The more labs you have, the faster the rating increases. Each lab generates communication points per year toward understanding a specific race.
- **Contact Time**: Having ships in proximity to alien vessels or installations generates a small amount of passive communication progress, as your linguists can observe and analyze alien transmissions.
- **Diplomacy Teams**: Officers assigned to diplomatic roles can accelerate communication efforts based on their diplomacy skill.
- **Communication Equipment**: Ships can be equipped with specialized communication arrays that improve the rate of language acquisition during active contact.

### Communication Technology

Several technologies affect your communication capabilities:

- **Xenology**: The base technology that enables construction of xenology labs. Higher levels improve lab efficiency.
- **Alien Language Analysis**: Improves the rate at which communication ratings increase.
- **Universal Translator**: Late-game technology that dramatically accelerates communication with all races.

**Tip**: Start building xenology labs early, even before you encounter aliens. When first contact does happen, you will want the infrastructure already in place to begin decoding their language immediately. The faster you can communicate, the better your chances of establishing peaceful relations before a misunderstanding triggers a war.

## 15.2.2 Diplomacy Window

The Diplomacy window is your primary interface for managing relationships with alien races. It is accessed from the main toolbar and provides a comprehensive view of your diplomatic status and available actions.

### Window Layout

The Diplomacy window is organized into several sections:

- **Race List**: The left panel displays all known alien races. Selecting a race shows detailed information in the other panels.
- **Relationship Status**: Shows the current diplomatic standing (hostile, unfriendly, neutral, friendly, allied) along with the numerical relationship value.
- **Communication Level**: Displays the current communication rating as a percentage.
- **Treaty Status**: Lists any active treaties between you and the selected race.
- **Action Panel**: Provides buttons for available diplomatic actions based on your communication level and current relationship.

### Relationship Values

The diplomatic relationship is tracked as a numerical value that determines the overall standing:

| Value Range | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Below -100 | Hostile | Active conflict likely or in progress |
| -100 to -25 | Unfriendly | Tensions high, limited diplomatic options |
| -25 to +25 | Neutral | No strong feelings either way |
| +25 to +75 | Friendly | Positive relations, most options available |
| Above +75 | Allied | Strong partnership, full cooperation |

Relationship values shift based on diplomatic actions, treaty compliance, military encounters, territorial disputes, and trade interactions.

### Available Actions

Depending on your communication level and current standing, the following actions may be available:

- **Propose Treaty**: Offer a treaty of a specific type (see Section 15.3).
- **Offer Trade**: Propose a trade agreement for minerals or technology.
- **Send Message**: Transmit a diplomatic message expressing intent.
- **Issue Demand**: Make a specific demand of the alien race.
- **Declare War**: Formally declare hostilities (always available regardless of communication level).
- **Sue for Peace**: Attempt to end an active conflict.

### Relationship Modifiers

Many in-game events affect relationship values:

- **Positive**: Successful treaties, trade, non-aggression in shared space, providing aid.
- **Negative**: Ships in their territory without permission, military buildups near their borders, treaty violations, attacking their assets.

**Tip**: Monitor relationship values carefully. A slow decline from neutral toward unfriendly often precedes an NPR deciding to attack. If you see the trend, address it diplomatically before it reaches the point of no return.

## 15.2.3 Messages and Demands

Once you have achieved sufficient communication with an alien race, you can exchange diplomatic messages and make demands. NPRs will also send you messages and demands of their own.

### Sending Messages

Diplomatic messages allow you to express intent without formal treaty negotiations:

- **Peaceful Intent**: Signal that you have no hostile intentions. Can help improve relations with nervous NPRs.
- **Territorial Claim**: Assert ownership of a system or region. NPRs may respect this or ignore it depending on their disposition.
- **Warning**: Advise the NPR to withdraw from a contested area. May be effective against less aggressive races.
- **Threat**: Promise military action if demands are not met. Can backfire with aggressive races who view threats as provocation.

Messages require a minimum communication level to send (typically 20-30%) and a higher level for the nuance to be properly conveyed. Sending a complex diplomatic message with low communication may result in misinterpretation.

### Receiving Messages

NPRs will send you messages expressing their own intentions and demands. These appear in your event log and should be taken seriously:

- **Greeting**: A neutral or friendly contact message. Usually a good sign.
- **Warning**: The NPR is unhappy about something -- often your ships in their space. Pay attention.
- **Demand**: The NPR wants something specific from you. Compliance improves relations; refusal may worsen them.
- **Ultimatum**: A serious threat usually backed by military force. Ignoring this often leads to war.
- **Declaration of War**: Hostilities have begun. This is not a negotiating position.

### Making Demands

You can make specific demands of alien races:

- **Withdraw Ships**: Demand the NPR remove vessels from a particular system.
- **Cede Territory**: Demand the NPR abandon a colony or claim.
- **Pay Tribute**: Demand minerals or other resources as payment.
- **Technology Transfer**: Demand the NPR share specific technologies.

The likelihood of an NPR complying with demands depends on:

- Their assessment of your military strength relative to theirs.
- Their aggression level (aggressive races are less likely to comply).
- The severity of the demand (small requests are more likely to succeed).
- Your current relationship (friendly races may accommodate reasonable requests).

### NPR Demands

NPRs will also make demands of you. You can choose to comply or refuse:

- **Compliance**: Improves relations and avoids conflict, but may embolden the NPR to make further demands.
- **Refusal**: Worsens relations and may trigger military action, but maintains your position and credibility.
- **Counter-proposal**: If communication is sufficient, you can sometimes negotiate a middle ground.

**Tip**: When an NPR makes a demand, evaluate not just the immediate cost of compliance but the precedent it sets. Giving in to one demand often leads to escalating demands. However, if you are not ready for war, a temporary concession can buy valuable time to build your fleet.
