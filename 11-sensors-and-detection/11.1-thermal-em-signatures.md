# 11.1 Thermal and EM Signatures

Every ship, missile, and orbital installation in Aurora radiates energy that can be detected by enemy sensors. Understanding how these signatures work is fundamental to both detecting opponents and avoiding detection yourself. There are two primary emission types: thermal signatures produced by engines and other heat-generating systems, and electromagnetic (EM) signatures produced by active sensors, shields, and other electronic equipment.

## 11.1.1 Thermal Signature

A ship's thermal signature represents the heat it radiates into space, primarily from its engines. The thermal signature is the single most important factor in determining whether a ship can be detected passively at long range.

**Base Thermal Signature Calculation**

The thermal signature of a ship is determined by its engine power output. The base formula is:

```
Thermal Signature = Total Engine Power / Engine Thermal Reduction
```

Each engine component has a thermal efficiency rating determined by the Thermal Reduction technology used in its design. The available thermal reduction levels are:

| Technology | Thermal Reduction | Fuel Consumption Multiplier |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| No Reduction | 1.0x | 1.0x |
| Thermal Reduction x0.75 | 0.75x signature | 2.0x fuel |
| Thermal Reduction x0.50 | 0.50x signature | 3.0x fuel |
| Thermal Reduction x0.25 | 0.25x signature | 4.0x fuel |
| Thermal Reduction x0.10 | 0.10x signature | 10.0x fuel |

This represents a deliberate trade-off: reducing your thermal output dramatically increases fuel consumption. A ship with 0.25x thermal reduction burns fuel four times faster than an equivalent ship with no reduction.

**When Thermal Signature is Emitted**

A ship only produces its full thermal signature when its engines are actively running. A ship that is stationary (not accelerating or decelerating) produces zero thermal signature from its engines. This is a critical tactical consideration: a ship that cuts its engines and drifts ballistically becomes much harder to detect thermally.

However, certain other components contribute to thermal signature regardless of engine status:

- **Power plants** do not contribute to thermal signature in C# Aurora
- **Shields** generate thermal signature when active (see Section 11.1.2 for the EM component, which is typically more significant)

**Practical Implications**

- Large, fast warships with powerful engines are visible at enormous distances
- Slow freighters with modest engines are harder to spot thermally
- A fleet that arrives in-system and then goes ballistic effectively disappears from thermal detection until it lights its engines again
- Fighters and FAC (Fast Attack Craft) have small engines in absolute terms but often have high power-to-weight ratios, making their thermal signatures moderate relative to their size

**Example:** A destroyer with 4,000 EP (engine power) and standard engines has a thermal signature of 4,000. The same ship redesigned with Thermal Reduction x0.50 engines has a thermal signature of 2,000 but burns three times the fuel per hour of operation.

## 11.1.2 EM Signature

The electromagnetic signature represents electronic emissions from a ship's active systems. While thermal signature is generated by engines, EM signature comes from a variety of sources.

**Sources of EM Signature**

| Source | EM Contribution |
|--------|----------------|
| Active Sensors (while active) | Equal to the sensor's EM output rating |
| Shields (while active) | Shield strength value |
| ECM (while active) | Contributes to EM signature |
| Active Search Sensors on missiles | Missile sensor rating |

**Active Sensor Emissions**

The largest source of EM signature for most warships is their active sensors. Each active sensor component has a rated EM output that is added to the ship's total EM signature whenever that sensor is turned on. Larger, more powerful sensors emit more, creating a fundamental tension: the better you can see, the more visible you become.

The EM emission of an active sensor is calculated as:

```
Sensor EM Output = Sensor Size (HS) * Active Sensor Strength tech level
```

A ship can reduce its EM signature by turning off its active sensors, relying instead on passive detection or on the active sensors of other ships in the task group. This is a common fleet tactic: designate one or two sensor pickets to radiate actively while the rest of the fleet listens passively.

**Shield Emissions**

Active shields generate EM signature equal to their total shield strength. This means a heavily shielded ship that raises its shields is broadcasting its position to any EM sensor in range. Many commanders keep shields down during approach and only raise them when combat is imminent.

**Practical Example**

Consider a cruiser with:
- A size-10 active sensor using strength-20 technology: EM output = 200
- Shields rated at 150 total strength: EM output = 150
- Total EM signature when fully active: 350

If the commander turns off the active sensor and lowers shields, the cruiser's EM signature drops to zero (assuming no other emitting systems). This represents a major tactical choice between situational awareness/protection and stealth.

## 11.1.3 Signature Reduction

Beyond the engine-level thermal reduction technology discussed above, there are several additional methods to reduce your ships' detectability.

**Thermal Signature Reduction Technology**

The primary method for reducing thermal signatures is selecting a higher thermal reduction level when designing engines. This is set at design time and cannot be changed afterward. The trade-off with fuel efficiency makes this a strategic rather than tactical decision.

**Emission Control (EMCON)**

Ships and task groups can be placed in Emission Control mode, which prevents them from using active sensors and other emitting systems. Under EMCON:

- Active sensors are turned off (EM signature from sensors = 0)
- The ship relies entirely on passive sensors
- Shields can optionally be lowered
- The ship retains its thermal signature if engines are running

EMCON is the most common tactical method for reducing EM signature. See Section 11.4.2 for detailed discussion.

**Reducing Speed**

Since thermal signature is proportional to engine power being used, a ship that reduces its speed (using less than maximum thrust) proportionally reduces its thermal signature. A ship at 50% thrust produces 50% of its maximum thermal signature.

**Going Ballistic**

A ship that cuts engines entirely and drifts on its current vector produces zero thermal signature from engines. This is the ultimate thermal stealth measure but sacrifices all maneuverability. A ship on a ballistic course cannot change heading or speed without lighting up its engines again.

**Cloaking Devices**

Researching and installing cloaking devices provides a percentage reduction to both thermal and EM signatures. See Section 11.4.1 for full details on cloaking technology.

**Small Ship Advantage**

Smaller ships inherently have smaller absolute signatures because they mount smaller engines. A 500-ton FAC might have engines producing a thermal signature of 200, while a 15,000-ton battlecruiser might produce 6,000. Both are detectable, but the FAC's detection range is dramatically smaller.

**Design Tips for Signature Reduction**

- Consider split engine designs: one set of efficient engines for cruising, another set (with thermal reduction) for combat maneuvering
- Do not over-engine your ships if stealth matters; the minimum speed needed for your mission should drive engine sizing
- Remember that thermal reduction increases fuel consumption multiplicatively -- plan your fuel storage accordingly
- EM signature is entirely within your tactical control: keep active sensors off until you need them
- Shield emissions can be avoided by keeping shields down during approach phases
