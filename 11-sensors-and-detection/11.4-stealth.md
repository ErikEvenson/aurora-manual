# 11.4 Stealth

Stealth in Aurora is not a single technology but a combination of design choices, equipment, and tactical decisions that reduce a ship's detectability. From dedicated cloaking devices to the simple expedient of turning off your sensors, stealth operations require understanding exactly how detection works and exploiting its limitations.

## 11.4.1 Cloaking Technology

Cloaking devices are specialized components that reduce a ship's thermal and EM signatures by a percentage. They represent advanced materials and energy absorption systems that mask a ship's emissions.

**How Cloaking Works**

A cloaking device reduces a ship's effective signatures as follows:

```
Effective Thermal Signature = Base Thermal Signature * (1 - Cloak Percentage)
Effective EM Signature = Base EM Signature * (1 - Cloak Percentage)
```

Cloaking technology is researched through the Sensors and Fire Control tech tree. The available levels provide increasing signature reduction:

| Technology | Signature Reduction |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Cloaking Efficiency 20% | 20% reduction |
| Cloaking Efficiency 30% | 30% reduction |
| Cloaking Efficiency 40% | 40% reduction |
| Cloaking Efficiency 50% | 50% reduction |
| Cloaking Efficiency 60% | 60% reduction |
| Cloaking Efficiency 70% | 70% reduction |
| Cloaking Efficiency 80% | 80% reduction |

**Cloaking Device Size**

The cloaking device must be sized appropriately for the ship. The device's size is proportional to the ship's total hull size:

```
Cloak Size = Ship Size (HS) * Cloak Size Multiplier
```

The cloak size multiplier depends on the Cloaking Sensor Reduction technology level. Higher tech levels produce smaller, more efficient cloaking devices. At early tech levels, a cloaking device might consume 20-30% of a ship's total hull space, making it a significant design commitment.

**Cloaking Limitations**

- Cloaking devices reduce but do not eliminate signatures. A large ship with powerful engines and a 50% cloak still has a substantial thermal signature.
- Cloaking does not affect a ship's cross-section for active sensor detection. Active sensors detect based on the target's physical size, which cloaking cannot alter.
- Cloaking devices consume power and hull space, reducing the capacity for other systems.
- The reduction applies multiplicatively with other signature management (thermal reduction engines plus cloaking provides compounding stealth benefit).

**Cloaking and Active Sensors**

This is a critical interaction: a cloaked ship that turns on its active sensors still produces EM emissions. The cloak reduces those emissions, but a ship with a 240 EM output from active sensors and a 50% cloak still emits 120 -- easily detectable. Cloaked ships typically operate under EMCON to maximize their stealth advantage.

**Design Considerations**

- Cloaking devices work best on small, slow ships with thermal-reduced engines. The percentage reduction compounds with low base signatures.
- On large battleships with massive engines, even 80% cloaking still leaves detectable signatures at significant ranges.
- The hull space cost of cloaking is substantial. You are trading weapon, sensor, or engine capacity for stealth.
- Consider whether the stealth benefit justifies the cost: a ship that must fight at close range may be better served by more armor and weapons than by a cloak.

**Example:** A 5,000-ton scout with thermal-reduced engines (signature 400) and a 60% cloak:
- Effective thermal signature: 400 * 0.4 = 160
- This ship is extremely hard to detect thermally, with detection ranges roughly 63% of what they would be against its uncloaked thermal signature (sqrt of 0.4)

## 11.4.2 Emission Control

Emission Control (EMCON) is the tactical practice of restricting a ship's electronic emissions to reduce its EM signature. Unlike cloaking, EMCON is a command decision that can be activated or deactivated instantly, but it comes with significant operational restrictions.

**Activating EMCON**

EMCON can be set at the task group level or individual ship level. When a ship is under EMCON:

- All active sensors are turned off
- No active sensor emissions contribute to EM signature
- The ship relies entirely on passive sensors (thermal and EM)
- Shields can be raised or lowered independently of EMCON status, though raising shields defeats the purpose of EMCON since shields produce EM signature
- Fire controls are not available (cannot guide missiles or engage with beam weapons)

**EMCON Levels**

Aurora C# supports multiple EMCON settings that allow graduated emission control:

- **Full EMCON:** All active emissions suppressed. Ship is completely passive.
- **EMCON with distance threshold:** Active sensors activate automatically when a target is detected within a specified range by passive sensors.
- **No EMCON:** All systems operate normally.

The distance-threshold option allows a ship to remain stealthy during approach but automatically activate weapons and sensors when the enemy reaches engagement range.

**Trade-offs of EMCON**

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|-------------|
| Zero EM from sensors | Cannot use active sensors |
| Enemy cannot detect via EM | Reduced detection capability |
| Tactical surprise | Cannot guide missiles |
| Can approach undetected | Must rely on passive data only |

**When to Use EMCON**

- **Approach phase:** Moving into engagement range without being detected
- **Ambush operations:** Waiting on a jump point or along a transit route
- **Evasion:** Breaking contact when outnumbered
- **Reconnaissance:** Observing enemy fleet movements without revealing your presence
- **Picket operations:** Listening posts that passively monitor for thermal/EM contacts

**When NOT to Use EMCON**

- Active combat (you need fire controls)
- When you have already been detected (the advantage is lost)
- When you need to detect targets that are also under EMCON (only active sensors find silent targets)
- When guiding missiles that lack onboard sensors

**Combining EMCON with Ballistic Movement**

The ultimate stealth configuration combines EMCON (zero EM) with ballistic movement (zero thermal). A ship that is both ballistic and under EMCON is effectively invisible to all passive sensors. Only an active sensor sweep can detect it, and then only if the active sensor has appropriate resolution for the ship's tonnage.

This combination requires careful pre-planning: you must set your ballistic course before going silent, and you cannot maneuver without breaking thermal stealth.

## 11.4.3 Stealth Tactics

Understanding detection mechanics enables several tactical approaches that exploit the limitations of enemy sensors.

**The Passive Fleet Approach**

Designate one expendable scout ship as the active sensor platform. All other ships in the fleet operate under EMCON, receiving detection data from the scout via shared task group sensors. The enemy sees only one contact (the scout) while the main fleet remains hidden until engagement range.

Variations:
- Use a cheap, fast FAC as the sensor ship -- it can flee or be sacrificed
- Position the sensor ship ahead of the main fleet to draw fire
- Use the sensor ship's active ping to force the enemy to reveal their position through maneuvering

**The Silent Approach**

For attacking a known position (enemy colony, orbital station, jump point):

1. Approach under EMCON at maximum speed until within passive detection range
2. Cut engines and drift ballistically, now invisible to both thermal and EM detection
3. Coast to engagement range (requires advance course calculation)
4. At optimal range, activate all sensors, raise shields, and fire simultaneously

This tactic is devastating against enemies who rely on passive detection. The disadvantage is the inability to course-correct during the ballistic phase.

**Jump Point Ambush**

Station a fleet on a jump point under full EMCON with engines off:

1. Ships are completely undetectable (zero thermal, zero EM)
2. When an enemy transits the jump point, they appear at close range
3. Immediately activate sensors and weapons for a point-blank engagement
4. The enemy has no warning and minimal time to react

This is one of the most powerful tactical positions in Aurora, as the transiting fleet suffers from jump shock (reduced sensor capability) and cannot retreat immediately.

**Missile Approach Vectors**

When launching missiles at a stealthy target:

- Missiles with active onboard sensors will emit EM, making them detectable but self-guiding
- Missiles without onboard sensors require continuous fire control guidance but are harder to detect
- Consider launching passive-guided missiles under fire control until close range, then switching to a low-resolution sensor for final approach targeting

**Counter-Stealth Operations**

To find hidden enemies:

1. **Broad active sweeps:** Use high-power active sensors at multiple resolutions to scan the system
2. **Patrol patterns:** Cover likely approach vectors with active sensor-equipped scouts
3. **Gravitational survey:** Newly detected jump points may indicate where enemies entered the system
4. **Missile scouts:** Launch long-range missiles with onboard sensors on search patterns (expensive but effective)
5. **Buoy networks:** Deploy sensor buoys at strategic locations for passive detection coverage

**Stealth Ship Design Principles**

For a dedicated stealth combatant:

- Small hull (1,000-5,000 tons) to minimize active sensor cross-section
- Thermal-reduced engines (0.25x or lower) to minimize thermal signature
- Cloaking device (highest available percentage)
- Primarily passive sensors with one small active sensor for emergency/attack use
- Missiles with onboard sensors (reduces need for fire control emissions)
- Minimal or no shields (shield EM is counter-productive for stealth ships)
- Sufficient fuel for ballistic approach followed by powered withdrawal

**Common Stealth Mistakes**

- Forgetting that shields generate EM: raising shields on approach breaks stealth
- Designing a cloaked ship with oversized engines: the thermal signature overwhelms the cloak benefit
- Relying on EMCON against an enemy with active sensors: EMCON only defeats passive EM detection, not active sweeps
- Launching missiles without onboard sensors from a ship under EMCON: the missiles cannot be guided without an active fire control
- Going ballistic without accounting for the target's movement: you cannot adjust course, and the target may move out of your approach path
