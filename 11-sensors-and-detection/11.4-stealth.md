# 11.4 Stealth

Stealth in Aurora is not a single technology but a combination of design choices, equipment, and tactical decisions that reduce a ship's detectability. From dedicated cloaking devices to the simple expedient of turning off your sensors, stealth operations require understanding exactly how detection works and exploiting its limitations.

## 11.4.1 Cloaking Technology

Cloaking devices are specialized components that reduce a ship's thermal and EM signatures by a percentage. They represent advanced materials and energy absorption systems that mask a ship's emissions.

**How Cloaking Works**

A cloaking device reduces a ship's effective signatures as follows:

```
Effective Thermal Signature = Base Thermal Signature * (1 - Cloak Percentage)
Effective EM Signature = Base EM Signature * (1 - Cloak Percentage)
```

Cloaking technology is researched through the Sensors and Fire Control tech tree (see [Section 7.4 Tech Categories](../7-research/7.4-tech-categories.md)). Two separate research lines interact:

1. **Cloaking Sensor Reduction** -- determines the percentage of signature reduction (what percentage of thermal and EM signatures are masked)
2. **Cloaking Efficiency** -- determines the efficiency multiplier (3 to 15), which controls how large the cloak device needs to be

The available signature reduction levels are:

| Technology | Signature Reduction |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Cloaking Sensor Reduction 20% | 20% reduction |
| Cloaking Sensor Reduction 30% | 30% reduction |
| Cloaking Sensor Reduction 40% | 40% reduction |
| Cloaking Sensor Reduction 50% | 50% reduction |
| Cloaking Sensor Reduction 60% | 60% reduction |
| Cloaking Sensor Reduction 70% | 70% reduction |
| Cloaking Sensor Reduction 80% | 80% reduction |

**Cloaking Device Size**

The cloaking device must be sized appropriately for the ship. The device's size is proportional to the ship's total hull size:

```
Cloak Size = Ship Size (HS) * Cloak Size Multiplier
```

The cloak size multiplier depends on the Cloaking Sensor Reduction technology level. Higher tech levels produce smaller, more efficient cloaking devices.

**Cloaking efficiency multiplier:** The efficiency multiplier ranges from 3 to 15 depending on the researched technology level. Higher efficiency means a smaller cloak device for the same percentage of signature reduction. Research costs escalate dramatically with efficiency: from 4,000 RP at efficiency 3 up to 500,000 RP at efficiency 15.

**Cloaking device size constraints:**
- **Minimum size:** 2 to 25 HS depending on the researched device size technology. Research costs are inversely proportional to size: 500,000 RP for size 2 down to 1,000 RP for size 25.
- **Maximum size:** 100 HS. No cloaking device can exceed this size regardless of the ship's hull.
- At early tech levels, a cloaking device might consume 20-30% of a ship's total hull space, making it a significant design commitment.

**Sensor Reduction research costs:** The sensor reduction percentage determines how effectively the cloak masks the ship. Research costs escalate dramatically at higher percentages: 4,000 RP at 75% reduction up to 2,000,000 RP at 99.5% reduction. The practical sweet spot is typically 80-90% reduction, as the RP cost for the final few percentage points is extremely high relative to the benefit.

As of v1.11.0, the ship designer enforces a minimum size requirement: cloaking devices must be large enough to physically fit within the ship design. Designs that attempt to mount undersized cloaking devices will be rejected, preventing non-functional cloak installations.

**Cloaking and Cross-Section (v2.0 Changes)**

In C# Aurora v2.0, important changes were made to how cloaking interacts with a ship's cross-section for detection and combat purposes:

- **Cloaked Cross-Section:** A ship with an operational cloak is always treated as having its cloaked (reduced) cross-section for both detection and combat targeting purposes.
- **Damaged Cloak Behavior (v2.0):** In v2.0 and later, the current state of the cloak is taken into account. If the cloak is damaged, the cross-section reverts to normal for both detection and combat purposes. This differs from v1.13 where a damaged cloak still provided the full cloaked cross-section.
- **Fire Control Lock-On:** In v2.0, missile fire controls properly use the reduced cloaked cross-section when targeting cloaked vessels. A previous bug allowed missile fire controls to lock on using the full (uncloaked) cross-section, which has been fixed.

These changes mean that maintaining cloak integrity is now tactically critical during combat. A damaged cloak becomes a liability as it provides no cross-section reduction while still consuming hull space.

**Cloaking Limitations**

- Cloaking devices reduce but do not eliminate signatures. A large ship with powerful engines and a 50% cloak still has a substantial thermal signature.
- Cloaking reduces a ship's effective cross-section for active sensor detection and fire control targeting (v2.0+). This is a significant defensive benefit as it reduces both detection range and weapon accuracy.
- Cloaking devices consume power and hull space, reducing the capacity for other systems.
- If the cloak is damaged, the ship reverts to its full uncloaked cross-section immediately (v2.0+).
- The reduction applies multiplicatively with other signature management (thermal reduction engines plus cloaking provides compounding stealth benefit).

**Cloaking and Active Sensors**

This is a critical interaction: a cloaked ship that turns on its active sensors still produces EM emissions. The cloak reduces those emissions, but a ship with a 240 EM output from active sensors and a 50% cloak still emits 120 -- easily detectable. Cloaked ships typically operate under EMCON to maximize their stealth advantage.

**Design Considerations**

- Cloaking devices work best on small, slow ships with thermal-reduced engines. The percentage reduction compounds with low base signatures.
- On large battleships with massive engines, even 80% cloaking still leaves detectable signatures at significant ranges.
- The hull space cost of cloaking is substantial. You are trading weapon, sensor, or engine capacity for stealth.
- Consider whether the stealth benefit justifies the cost: a ship that must fight at close range may be better served by more armor and weapons than by a cloak.
- In v2.0+, cloak integrity is critical in combat. Armor and redundancy to protect the cloak component should be considered in the design, as a damaged cloak provides zero cross-section benefit.
- The cross-section reduction from cloaking affects both enemy fire control lock-on and active sensor detection range, making cloaked ships harder to target with missiles as well as harder to detect.

**Example:** A 5,000-ton scout with thermal-reduced engines (signature 400) and a 60% cloak:
- Effective thermal signature: 400 * 0.4 = 160
- Effective cross-section for active sensors: also reduced by cloak percentage
- This ship is extremely hard to detect thermally, with detection ranges roughly 63% of what they would be against its uncloaked thermal signature (sqrt of 0.4)
- If the cloak is damaged in combat, the ship immediately reverts to full thermal signature (400) and full cross-section

## 11.4.2 Emission Control

Emission Control (EMCON) is the tactical practice of restricting a ship's electronic emissions to reduce its EM signature. Unlike cloaking, EMCON is a command decision that can be activated or deactivated instantly, but it comes with significant operational restrictions.

**Activating EMCON**

EMCON can be set at the task group level or individual ship level. When a ship is under EMCON:

- All active sensors are turned off
- No active sensor emissions contribute to EM signature
- The ship relies entirely on passive sensors (thermal and EM)
- Shields can be raised or lowered independently of EMCON status, though raising shields defeats the purpose of EMCON since shields produce EM signature
- Fire controls are not available (cannot guide missiles or engage with beam weapons)

**EMCON Levels**

Aurora C# supports multiple EMCON settings that allow graduated emission control:

- **Full EMCON:** All active emissions suppressed. Ship is completely passive.
- **EMCON with distance threshold:** Active sensors activate automatically when a target is detected within a specified range by passive sensors.
- **No EMCON:** All systems operate normally.

The distance-threshold option allows a ship to remain stealthy during approach but automatically activate weapons and sensors when the enemy reaches engagement range.

**Trade-offs of EMCON**

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|-------------|
| Zero EM from sensors | Cannot use active sensors |
| Enemy cannot detect via EM | Reduced detection capability |
| Tactical surprise | Cannot guide missiles |
| Can approach undetected | Must rely on passive data only |

**When to Use EMCON**

- **Approach phase:** Moving into engagement range without being detected
- **Ambush operations:** Waiting on a jump point or along a transit route
- **Evasion:** Breaking contact when outnumbered
- **Reconnaissance:** Observing enemy fleet movements without revealing your presence
- **Picket operations:** Listening posts that passively monitor for thermal/EM contacts

**When NOT to Use EMCON**

- Active combat (you need fire controls)
- When you have already been detected (the advantage is lost)
- When you need to detect targets that are also under EMCON (only active sensors find silent targets)
- When guiding missiles that lack onboard sensors

**Combining EMCON with No Movement Orders**

The ultimate stealth configuration combines EMCON (zero EM) with cancelling movement orders (idle thermal only). A ship under EMCON with no movement orders produces only its idle thermal signature (5% of HS) and zero EM signature, making it nearly invisible to passive sensors -- though not completely undetectable as it was in VB6 Aurora.

For example, a 6,000-ton destroyer (120 HS) under EMCON with no movement orders:
- Thermal signature: 6 (120 * 0.05)
- EM signature: 0
- Detection by passive thermal sensors: extremely short range only
- Detection by EM sensors: impossible
- Detection by active sensors: based on full tonnage (6,000 tons) at normal active sensor range

This combination requires careful pre-planning: you must cancel movement orders (the ship will remain at its current position) or accept that you cannot maneuver without increasing your thermal signature. Only an active sensor sweep can reliably detect such a ship at meaningful range.

## 11.4.3 Stealth Tactics

Understanding detection mechanics enables several tactical approaches that exploit the limitations of enemy sensors.

**The Passive Fleet Approach**

Designate one expendable scout ship as the active sensor platform. All other ships in the fleet operate under EMCON, receiving detection data from the scout via shared task group sensors. The enemy sees only one contact (the scout) while the main fleet remains hidden until engagement range.

Variations:
- Use a cheap, fast FAC as the sensor ship -- it can flee or be sacrificed
- Position the sensor ship ahead of the main fleet to draw fire
- Use the sensor ship's active ping to force the enemy to reveal their position through maneuvering

**The Silent Approach**

For attacking a known position (enemy colony, orbital station, jump point):

1. Approach under EMCON at reduced speed to minimize thermal signature
2. At a calculated distance, cancel movement orders to drop to idle thermal (5% of HS) -- note this stops the ship rather than maintaining drift as in VB6
3. Resume movement at the last moment, approaching at maximum speed for a short burst
4. At optimal range, activate all sensors, raise shields, and fire simultaneously

In C# Aurora, ships without movement orders are stationary rather than drifting ballistically. This changes the silent approach from a drift-and-coast maneuver to a stop-and-sprint tactic. The advantage is precision positioning; the disadvantage is the ship must remain stationary during the silent phase.

**Jump Point Ambush**

Station a fleet on a jump point under full EMCON with no movement orders:

1. Ships produce only idle thermal signature (5% of HS) and zero EM -- nearly undetectable by passive sensors
2. When an enemy transits the jump point, they appear at close range
3. Immediately activate sensors and weapons for a point-blank engagement
4. The enemy has no warning and minimal time to react

This remains one of the most powerful tactical positions in Aurora, as the transiting fleet suffers from jump shock (reduced sensor capability) and cannot retreat immediately. The idle thermal signature of ambushing ships is typically too small to be detected before transit.

**Missile Approach Vectors**

When launching missiles at a stealthy target:

- Missiles with active onboard sensors (see [Section 12.3 Missiles](../12-combat/12.3-missiles.md)) will emit EM, making them detectable but self-guiding
- Missiles without onboard sensors require continuous fire control guidance but are harder to detect
- Consider launching passive-guided missiles under fire control until close range, then switching to a low-resolution sensor for final approach targeting

**Counter-Stealth Operations**

To find hidden enemies:

1. **Broad active sweeps:** Use high-power active sensors at multiple resolutions to scan the system
2. **Patrol patterns:** Cover likely approach vectors with active sensor-equipped scouts
3. **Gravitational survey:** Newly detected jump points may indicate where enemies entered the system
4. **Missile scouts:** Launch long-range missiles with onboard sensors on search patterns (expensive but effective)
5. **Buoy networks:** Deploy sensor buoys at strategic locations for passive detection coverage

**Stealth Ship Design Principles**

For a dedicated stealth combatant:

- Small hull (1,000-5,000 tons) to minimize active sensor cross-section
- Thermal-reduced engines (0.25x or lower) to minimize thermal signature
- Cloaking device (highest available percentage)
- Primarily passive sensors with one small active sensor for emergency/attack use
- Missiles with onboard sensors (reduces need for fire control emissions)
- Minimal or no shields (shield EM is counter-productive for stealth ships)
- Sufficient fuel for ballistic approach followed by powered withdrawal

**Common Stealth Mistakes**

- Forgetting that shields generate EM: raising shields on approach breaks stealth
- Designing a cloaked ship with oversized engines: the thermal signature overwhelms the cloak benefit
- Relying on EMCON against an enemy with active sensors: EMCON only defeats passive EM detection, not active sweeps
- Launching missiles without onboard sensors from a ship under EMCON: the missiles cannot be guided without an active fire control
- In C# Aurora, ships without movement orders are stationary (not drifting). Plan your approach accordingly -- you cannot coast toward a target, only stop and restart engines
- In v2.0+, relying on a cloak for combat survivability without protecting it: a single hit to the cloak component removes all cross-section reduction benefits
