# 11.2 Passive Sensors

Passive sensors detect the emissions produced by other ships and installations without emitting any energy themselves. This makes them the foundation of stealthy operations: a ship using only passive sensors is invisible to EM detection (at least from its sensors). Aurora features two types of passive sensors -- thermal sensors that detect engine heat, and EM sensors that detect electromagnetic emissions from active systems.

## 11.2.1 Thermal Detection

Thermal sensors detect the heat signatures produced by ship engines. They are the primary means of locating ships that are under power but maintaining emission control.

**How Thermal Sensors Work**

A thermal sensor passively monitors for infrared and heat emissions in its vicinity. It does not emit anything itself, so it adds nothing to the detecting ship's signature. The detection range depends on three factors:

1. The sensitivity of the sensor (determined by its size and technology level)
2. The thermal signature of the target
3. The sensor's resolution matching the target's tonnage class

**Detection Range Formula**

The base detection range for a thermal sensor is:

```
Detection Range (km) = Sensor Rating * sqrt(Target Thermal Signature / Reference Signature)
```

Where:
- **Sensor Rating** is the sensor's maximum detection range against a target whose tonnage matches the sensor's resolution
- **Target Thermal Signature** is the current thermal output of the target (0 if engines are off)
- **Reference Signature** is the baseline signature for comparison

More specifically, the sensor range displayed in the component design window represents the range at which the sensor can detect a target with a thermal signature of the sensor's rated resolution (in HS). In practice, the detection range scales with the square root of the actual signature relative to the reference value.

**Sensor Design Parameters**

When designing a thermal sensor in the Component Design window, you set:

- **Sensor Size (HS):** Larger sensors have better range but take more hull space. Sizes range from 0.1 HS to 50 HS.
- **Resolution (tons):** The tonnage class the sensor is optimized for. Standard options range from 50 tons to 25,000 tons, in increments.
- **Technology Level:** The Thermal Sensor Sensitivity tech determines the base capability.

The sensor's rated detection range is:

```
Base Range = Size (HS) * Thermal Sensor Sensitivity * Resolution Modifier
```

**Resolution and Range Scaling**

A thermal sensor's resolution determines what size of target it can detect most efficiently. When a target's tonnage differs from the sensor's resolution:

- If the target is **larger** than the resolution, detection range increases (you are looking for a bigger heat source than your minimum threshold)
- If the target is **smaller** than the resolution, detection range decreases proportionally

The scaling formula is:

```
Effective Range = Base Range * (Target Tonnage / Sensor Resolution)
```

This means a sensor with resolution 5,000 tons will detect a 10,000-ton ship at approximately 1.41x its rated range (sqrt of 2), but will detect a 1,000-ton ship at only about 0.45x its rated range (sqrt of 0.2).

**Important:** A thermal sensor detects nothing if the target's engines are off, regardless of how powerful the sensor is. Thermal detection is entirely dependent on the target actively producing thrust.

**Practical Tips**

- Mount at least one thermal sensor on every warship -- it provides detection capability with zero EM cost
- Higher resolution sensors (set to larger tonnage) have longer absolute ranges but may miss small targets like missiles or FACs
- Lower resolution sensors (set to small tonnage like 50-100 tons) are essential for detecting missiles and small craft
- Multiple thermal sensors on one ship do not stack; only the best detection result counts for each contact
- Thermal sensors on different ships in a task group share their detections with the entire group

## 11.2.2 EM Detection

EM sensors detect the electromagnetic emissions from active sensors, shields, and other electronic systems. They are the other half of the passive detection picture and are essential for locating ships that are actively scanning.

**How EM Sensors Work**

An EM sensor monitors for radio-frequency, microwave, and other electromagnetic emissions. Like thermal sensors, EM sensors are completely passive and add nothing to your own ship's signature. They detect the EM signature of targets as described in Section 11.1.2.

**Detection Range Formula**

The detection range for an EM sensor follows the same mathematical structure as thermal sensors:

```
Detection Range (km) = Sensor Rating * sqrt(Target EM Signature / Reference Signature)
```

The key difference is that EM signature comes from active systems (sensors, shields) rather than engines. A target that is running under EMCON with all active systems off has an EM signature of zero and cannot be detected by EM sensors, regardless of their power.

**Sensor Design Parameters**

EM sensor design mirrors thermal sensor design:

- **Sensor Size (HS):** Larger = better range, more hull space
- **Resolution (tons):** Optimized detection tonnage class
- **Technology Level:** The EM Sensor Sensitivity tech determines base capability

**When EM Sensors Are Most Useful**

EM sensors excel in specific scenarios:

1. **Detecting active scanners:** Any ship using active sensors is broadcasting its position. Your EM sensors will typically detect these ships at greater range than the active sensor itself can see, giving you an intelligence advantage.
2. **Detecting shielded ships:** Ships with active shields produce EM equal to their shield strength.
3. **Locating sensor pickets:** The enemy's forward scouts using active sensors are your EM sensors' primary prey.
4. **Missile detection:** Active homing missiles emit from their onboard sensors and can be detected by EM sensors.

**EM vs. Thermal: When Each Matters**

| Situation | Thermal | EM |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| Target under power, EMCON | Detectable | Not detectable |
| Target stationary, sensors active | Not detectable | Detectable |
| Target under power, sensors active | Detectable | Detectable |
| Target ballistic, EMCON | Not detectable | Not detectable |

**Practical Tips**

- An EM sensor will often detect an enemy's active sensor at greater range than that active sensor can detect you -- this is a fundamental asymmetry that favors passive play
- Pair EM sensors with thermal sensors on every scout ship for complete passive coverage
- EM sensors are critical for detecting cloaked ships that use active sensors (the cloak reduces but does not eliminate EM signature)
- In fleet battles, your EM sensors may provide the first warning of incoming active-homing missiles

## 11.2.3 Sensor Resolution

Resolution is one of the most important and commonly misunderstood aspects of Aurora's sensor system. It determines the size of target your sensor is optimized to detect and directly affects detection ranges against targets of different sizes.

**How Resolution Works**

Every sensor (thermal, EM, or active) has a resolution setting expressed in tons. This represents the smallest target the sensor is designed to detect at its rated range. The resolution is set during component design and cannot be changed after manufacturing.

Standard resolution options in Aurora C# range from 1 HS (50 tons) to 500 HS (25,000 tons), though the exact increments available depend on the game version. Common resolution values include:

| Resolution (HS) | Resolution (tons) | Typical Use |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | 50 | Missile detection |
| 2 | 100 | Fighter/FAC detection |
| 4 | 200 | Small craft |
| 6 | 300 | Corvettes |
| 10 | 500 | Frigates |
| 20 | 1,000 | Destroyers |
| 50 | 2,500 | Light cruisers |
| 100 | 5,000 | Cruisers |
| 200 | 10,000 | Battlecruisers |
| 320 | 16,000 | Battleships |
| 500 | 25,000 | Large warships |

**The Resolution Trade-Off**

Higher resolution (larger tonnage) sensors have longer absolute detection ranges because the detection formula includes resolution as a multiplier. However, they suffer severe penalties when trying to detect targets smaller than their resolution.

Lower resolution sensors have shorter absolute ranges but can detect smaller targets. A resolution-1 sensor designed for missile detection will detect a missile at its rated range, but its rated range is much shorter than a resolution-500 sensor looking for battleships.

**Key Rules:**

1. A sensor can always detect a target larger than its resolution. The range increases proportionally.
2. A sensor can detect targets smaller than its resolution, but at reduced range scaling by the size ratio.
3. The most important decision is matching sensor resolution to the threats you expect to face.

**Resolution and Tonnage Matching**

When a target's tonnage matches the sensor resolution exactly, the sensor operates at its full rated range. The detection range scales as:

```
Effective Range = Rated Range * (Target Actual Size / Sensor Resolution)
```

For passive sensors, the target's signature further modifies this:

```
Final Range = Effective Range * sqrt(Target Signature / Expected Signature for that tonnage)
```

**Fleet Sensor Coverage**

A well-designed fleet typically includes sensors at multiple resolutions:

- **Resolution 1-2 (50-100 tons):** Dedicated missile/fighter detection sensors, often on specialized picket ships or the main fleet flagship
- **Resolution 10-20 (500-1,000 tons):** General-purpose sensors for detecting escorts and destroyers
- **Resolution 100+ (5,000+ tons):** Long-range search sensors for finding capital ships at maximum distance

**Practical Tips**

- Do not design all your sensors at the same resolution; you need a spread of resolutions to cover different threat types
- Missile detection requires resolution 1 sensors -- without them, you may not see incoming missiles until they are very close
- A single large ship with multiple resolution sensors can serve as an effective sensor platform for an entire fleet
- Remember that resolution affects both passive and active sensors identically in terms of the size-matching calculation
- Survey ships exploring unknown space should carry high-resolution sensors (looking for large unknowns at maximum range) paired with low-resolution sensors (for spotting small, fast scouts)
